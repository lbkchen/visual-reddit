# Which subreddits give the most karma?

## One metric: posts usually become 'viral' or hit the front page of reddit once they've
## reached 3000 karma. We will take all posts over 3000 karma, and scale their karma relatively
## to 3000 (e.g. 6000 becomes 6000/3000 = 2 points in our new metric), and figure out which 
## subreddits (subforums) have the most overall points
