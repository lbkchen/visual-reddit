"Sorry, but I had to remove your recent post on /r/dirtykikpals because your title did not comply with our official guidelines. 

This is the proper way to format a title: *AGE [R4R] DESCRIPTION*

Here is a TL;DR checklist of what should be in your subject:

**1. Use only M, F, T, and R for tagging gender.**

**2. Use [] around the R4R tag, so it looks like [R4R]. Don't use (), {}, or anything else.**

**3. For multiple ages or letter tags, only use /'s, so it looks like 21/21 [MF4R]. Don't use . , \\ | - : ; ~ or anything else.**

**4. Your age must be included before your [R4R].**

"Exhaust velocity is a direct function of the inverse of chamber pressure, the exit pressure and combustion temperature. The exit pressure can be calculated from the chamber pressure as well if you know your nozzle expansion ratio. As chamber pressure and combustion temperature increases and lower exit pressure, the exhaust velocity and mass flow rate goes up. 

Mass flow rate has a linear relation with chamber pressure, so that contributes more to thrust than the rise in chamber pressure in the exhaust velocity.

"You may still benefit from NoScript, which works as a generalized filter for Javascript, Java, Flash and other plug-ins. 


- AdBlock, as far as I'm aware, will only have an effect on site elements (primarily in the form of intrusive advertising) based on filter lists. Aside from this, filters can be applied to block tracking, social media and malware domains. Ultimately, with the way it utilizes filter lists that will either blacklist or whitelist page elements and domains based on huge filter lists, it doesn't cater to universally blocking scripts that NoScript would pick up on with every webpage you visit (e.g. if you visited a site AdBlock didn't have as part of its filter lists, it wouldn't function while NoScript would work every time), and as such, doesn't provide anywhere near the same level of security.

- Self-Destructing Cookies will simply manage browser cookies based on a set of rules you provide. It doesn't have any relevance to the scripts NoScript would deal with.

- Better Privacy also doesn't affect scripts, functioning much in the same way as Self-Destructing Cookies in that it only affects a variety of unwanted cookies as defined by the user.

- Disconnect, much like Better Privacy, only serves to notify and block tracking cookies accrued through visiting sites.

- Blur - same deal as above. 

- HTTPSEverywhere works differently from NoScript and all of the above add-ons in that it will seek out the HTTP Secure encryption protocol variant of any website you may visit and apply it before visiting the site, providing a layer of security. It has no capacity for blocking scripts, cookies, or anything else. 

- Privacy Badger works in the same way as the aforementioned Blur, Disconnect and Better Privacy. 

- IPFlood functions in an entirely different way to all previously-mentioned add-ons and NoScript, simulating a series of proxy IP addresses that override information sent via requests to websites by your browser at the application layer (most notably, information that would identify your real IP address while behind a proxy server) when sending requests to the server of any site you may visit.

__

In short, none of the listed add-ons (even when they're combined) will truly be able to replace NoScript's set of features. Actively using all of those add-ons that cater to tracking cookies (AdBlock, Better Privacy, Disconnect, Blur and Privacy Badger) will also slow your browser to a crawl when one or two would suffice.",false,false,t1_cmvnmbf,moogoogaijin,,0,1418665026,t5_2qh4p,t3_2pcwa5,t3_2pcwa5,5,1425387993,0,0,cmvnmbf,firefox,5,,,

"The singleship had been stripped to its aluminum spars.  The Rocket Jocks had started first, securing the fuel lines and surgically removing the cryogenic reaction mass tanks.  Zip guns and cutting wheels quietly eviscerated the crafts underbelly, unbolting what could be unbolted, and unwelding that which was welded.  Meanwhile, the Sparkys gutted the cockpit and the sensor pods, carefully stockpiling their precious electronics.  Two of the older kids, the Spectrum Spooks, had peeled the mirrored foil onto rollers, careful to preserve the swaths of midnight coloured metal.  

Terry floated at the end of the tether, arms crossed, judiciously observing the ant-like disassembly of the ship.  He watched as they deployed a device that looked like an inside-out umbrella - a blackbody radiator capped with a half-inch thick polarization filter.  

He gestured with one palm flat, and the other hand pointing straight up.  

*Out of plane.*

They didn’t need to ask.  The radiator sat at the end of an anchored stalk, pointed parallel to Solar North.  A thick insulated cable ran to the thermocouple within the ship, dumping the craft’s pent-up heat from its reservoir of molten sodium into the blackbody radiator, shining an infrared pencil-beam away from watchful eyes.  

Never can be too sure.

Tap tap tap tap.  Twenty three minutes elapsed.  She waved to Terry, holding up all five fingers, and lowering three.  He tapped the top of his helmet in lieu of a nod, and repeated the gesture to the organized chaos of the teenage crowd.

*Listen up twerps!  Seven minutes!  Hustle hustle hustle!*

Terry glanced back to his apprentice.  With deliberate exertion, she pressed her fingers together and tapped the faceplate of her helmet.

*Hungry...*

He patted the back of his helmet.

*I know.  I’m sorry.*

She quietly returned the gesture, before turning back to watch the recovery operation.

The singleship was scarcely recognizable.  A bare skeleton of the craft that once plied the coastline of the cosmos.  The piecemeal plundering of parts had passed, and the looted remnant lay lashed against the face of the rock.  Pneumatic anchors as long as a man’s leg were buried to the hilt within the primordial planetoid, pulling taut against the webbing of steel rope threaded through the ship’s frame; ensnaring their Lilliputian prize.  

Downspinning the reaction wheels would normally take hours.  They had five minutes.  There was no emergency stop for the dynamo of invisible inertia that the craft perched upon, as stopping suddenly would constitute an emergency of its own.  

A single cable snaked away from the craft’s gutted innards, floating just above the dark gritty chondrite, running past the junkyard bundle next to the utility craft some distance away.  Beyond the artificial barricade, eight suited figures knelt - shoulder to shoulder, belly to backpack.  The cable plugged into an adaptor.  The adaptor plugged into a control tablet.  The control tablet plugged into one pair of keyed gloves.  One pinkie finger extended, and tapped at empty space.  

The craft lurched violently within the steel webbing, pulling hard at the unyielding restraints.  The competing gyroscopic forces played against each other, forcing the singleship to writhe in lockstep with their torque fueled tango.  It spun nearly one quarter turn despite the strained wire rope, carving ruts in the soft rock as a stricken animal might make its last anguished claw marks against the jaws of a spring loaded trap.  

After some time, four minutes and thirty-nine seconds to be exact, the craft gave one final shudder and lay still.  Eight suited figures turned to look at the doctor and his apprentice.  

Radio silence was still in effect, but the two thumbs up from the bulky gloves said everything.  Terry clasped his hands together, then slapped one hand across his chest with two fingers extended.  

*Good job twerps!  Haven’t seen a chop job that fast since I made the mistake of stopping for coffee off the Jersey Turnpike.  Err.. wait.  Have any of you even seen a car before?  Pfeh.  Kids these days.  Wouldn’t last a minute in I-95 traffic.  Never mind.  Swell job anyhow.  Don’t get too comfy though.  Rendezvous in twenty minutes!*

Seven of the kids made their way to release the singleship from its ad-hoc anchorage.  One kicked off from the utility craft, and dove in the other direction, coming to a stop with a short puff from his suits hypergolic thrusters.  

She couldn’t make out the face behind the one-way permeable mesh.  The six foot spaceman reached over and slapped it’s glove over her faceplate, showing off a glowing arrow with a spiral wrapped around it;  a force diagram depicting an electromagnetic mass driver.  

Her hand patted the back of his glove, before waving dismissively.

*Well if it isn’t Jake O’Dwyer.  What’s the matter Jake, can’t find any other girls to pick on out here?*

He raised both arms and shook his hands, laughing heartily at her response.  He tapped two fingers over his wrist, and hooked his thumb over his shoulder.  Then one hand curled into a thumbs up, while the other hand swung out and punched her in the arm.  

*Ach!  Well our blade fulla cheek, inn’it?  Or whatever.  Aight, anyways, nice one scutchin` up into this ol rock.  Bleedin header of a bang up job ta is.  Give us a bell sometime an maybe we’ll run a tear.  Later, ya gobshite wee yank!*

Before he turned to leave, she slapped her hand against her thigh, and pointed at his leg.  His suit was mottled with sewn patches and SuperTape, all showing the telltale signs of age.  However, the patch on his right leg was still bright and clean.  

He patted his leg, and tapped the top of his helmet.  

*Nice one, no joke.  Feelin right fine that is now.  Ey, no free snogs outta the deal tho!*

She smiled behind her darkened faceplate, watching as he bounded away in a flying leap towards the utility craft.  He snapped his suit hook onto the seat of the ‘crotch rocket’, deftly straddling it while twirling his arm overhead.

*Oy!  Takeoff, takeoff!  Skive off ya knackers!*

A puff from the forward thrusters sent craft and rider rearing up, like a cavalry soldier from an earlier time.  A short blast from the wide rocket bell sent him flying towards Solar North, spraying nuggets of loose rock across the face of the asteroid, and trailing a coil of wire rope.  

Terry leaned over and plugged a cable into her helmet.

“You know, when I was your age, we didn’t ‘play doctor’ that literally.  Haah!”

She elbowed him.

“Not a bad job though.  Not bad for a rookie.”

“Thanks,” she conceded.

“Just make sure you don’t get too close to me for the next week.”

“Huh?  Why?”

“Oh, well you know.  I can’t take the chance of getting infected.”

“What?”

“COOTIES!  Haaah haaah!”  

She flicked the cable from her headset as Terry’s laughter devolved into a series of guttural snorts and gasps.  She rapped her fist on the side of her helmet and threw a backhanded gesture as she kicked away.  

Peace and quiet, once again.  

There was a short bright flash, followed by a low hiss.

She turned to look.  Terry had gone as still as a statue, raising one hand and cupping the other against the side of his helmet.  The other kids heard it too, glancing among each other to see if anyone would fess up to accidentally transmitting.

The static in her ears slowly resolved into something more organic, a faint voice drowned out by the whistling rush of air.  A whisper.  An agonized plea.

“...help.”

Her eyes raced up the beanstalk of wire rope.  It seemed to stretch off into infinity, as the crotch rocket had become an indistinguishable dot within the few short minutes.  

There was a short bright flash from the end of the wire.  The hissing stopped.

A rough shove sent her barrelling toward the rest of the group, gliding within fingertips reach over the porous gritty rock.  She turned back to look, moments after colliding into the outstretched arms of the others.  Terry tapped the side of his helmet and fanned his glove at his neck.  Then both arms folded over the top of his head.

"It depends what you will be wearing and what weapons you'll be using.

For brevity's sake, let's say you're going traditional caster, with light armour and a staff. In that case if you want to craft your own gear (which is *absolutely* worth it at least early on when drops can be a bit random and you don't have masses of money right out the gate) you'll want to focus on clothier (makes light and medium armour) and woodworking (makes staves and bows and shields).

You'll want to keep an eye out for jute and maple to harvest while you're out and about - they are reasonably plentiful. You can harvest other things as well and sell them or use them to dabble in other professions if you want. 

If you don't want to power level your way through crafting but want it to be a bit more organic, you'll want to think about making yourself a new full set of gear every 2 levels - you'll have more than enough materials for it. Every so often you'll find improvement materials - to begin with you need 5 of these to guarantee a 100% chance of a successful improvement on one of your existing pieces of gear. You can try with less but you run the risk of losing the piece altogether if it fails. So you might find that at first you have a lot of white (basic) armour instead of green (fine), but that's okay, it's early days and you don't really need it anyway.

If you want to augment your crafting in between making your own gear, you can disassemble all the gear you get from drops. You get a (good) chance at getting normal crafting materials from disassembling, and a (lesser) chance at getting improvement materials. You'll also sometimes get racial stones (that you need to craft an item with the aesthetics of a particular racial style). It also gives you crafting experience. Disassembling something that someone else has made gives you more experience than something that you have made, but it's still worth disassembling your own stuff. I don't know how much experience dropped/bought gear yields.

If you want to be able to craft the special sets in the game, you need to find the relevant crafting station - they are dotted around the world in some out-of-the-way places - you'll have to explore! They provide set bonuses depending on how many items from the set you have equipped. They can't be made anywhere else. You will need to have researched 2 traits on each item that you want to craft in that style in order to be able to craft from that special set. This restriction doesn't apply for normal gear. It's worth getting started on researching traits as soon as possible as they take real time to complete. Early on, though, you might be better waiting to research the ones you know you'll use, because you're limited to researching 1 trait at a time per profession (although there is a passive you can unlock later that increases this to 2 - not sure if you can increase it any more on top of that). 

It might be unrealistic to expect to focus on more than 1 or 2 crafts to any professional degree, simply because of the inventory space needed and time needed to research all the traits, not to mention the skill points you might want to put into the line in order to be more efficient and proficient, etc. Alchemy, provisioning and enchanting will eat your inventory space very, very quickly. However, food and potions and glyphs are readily available from merchants as soon as you get in the game, so it's not a massive problem. You'll probably find yourself dabbling in them anyway - it's hard not to. Even though I wasn't focusing on it, I certainly got a lot of use out of provisioning.

"&gt; std::map&lt;std::string, std::string&gt;

Either the standard tools have got much, much better, or you are really good at deciphering those. (Or googling.) In my day, I frequently misspelled a word, and had two pages of incomprehensible shit thrown at me.

&gt; our data structures should just be black boxes that only work in one way and aren't modular at all

That's my expectation of string.

&gt; I wonder what you have to say about those.

Exceptions tend to leaks since you have to free anything you've allocated before throwing, so they are only useful for ""fuck it, I quit"" type of situations (like the one they throw in `new`); also, stack traces usually get corrupted so you don't even know where it happened. (I used to _divide by zero_ instead of throwing an exception, since in that case you at least get your stack trace right.)

Generics are fine in Java, for example; in C++ they suck, partly because of the long mess of compiler errors, and partly because they don't work properly  with things like `const`. Their late addition to the language shows in having no way to initialise `std::vector` with ('foo', 'bar', 'baz') on spot. The time needed for their compilation is huge, and leads to unfathomable things like ""distributed compilation farms"" that are simply unheard of in any other language.

&gt; you shouldn't be talking about modern C++ when your knowledge of the language is a decade old.

See, my problem with C++ is that it had too many features that worked poorly with one another. This is a problem you can't solve by adding _even more_ features (which is what they've been doing).",false,false,t1_cmojsbc,maratc,,0,1418022659,t5_2qh0y,t3_2okodv,t1_cmoe0z7,1,1425545864,0,0,cmojsbc,Python,1,,,

"Major barriers? AI, modeling, and maps.

To do single player they would need to have AI, and that is an entire *huge* project all by itself. They'd probably have to hire someone if they don't already have someone familiar with the task, and it would be a lengthy project if they actually want anything decent out of it.

Modeling - if you want single-player, you're going to need a lot of additional interactive objects - vehicles, emplacements, installations, various sorts of buildings, etc. All of those need to be designed, modeled and textured, which is lots of artist time, plus any programmer time to implement any new functionality associated with them.

Maps - to put it bluntly, a single player component that simply reused all of the multiplayer maps would suck. There's a reason that all of the previous mechwarrior games had huge expansive maps where every single player mission was set in a different part of. The problem is, while in (say) the era of mechwarrior 3 you could get away with blocky maps that didn't have sophisticated geometry and reused generic environment textures, allowing relatively large areas to be created with only limited new material being needed, that's just not the case anymore. You'd need a dedicated team devoted to cranking out nothing but map after map for solely the single player component.

So it'd be nice, but I expect it to be a *very* long-term project if it ever happens at all.",false,false,t1_cmcrsnw,Mu0nNeutrino,Medium Mech Fan,0,1416938822,t5_2zm77,t3_2ne2xn,t3_2ne2xn,7,1425845869,0,0,cmcrsnw,OutreachHPG,7,,CWIE,

"I work in IT.

Specifically, I'm the tier of IT that your IT person calls when they need help.

Three basic things that make my life easier:

* **Update.** Run your system updates and update to the latest version of the product(s) you're having issues with before you call me. I work with contract software, so if you have a support contract, you're entitled to the most recent version. There's zero financial barrier to you being on the latest version, so PLEASE update. Our developers don't push out updates because they're bored. Every update includes fixes and enhancements. The issue you're calling about may already be fixed!


* **RTFM.** If I had to guess, I would say approximately 1 out of every 200 customers that I interact with actually brings me a new issue. That' means 99.5% of the time, I'm just reviewing the data and then giving you an article that was already available and searchable in our online documentation. The most egregious customers are those that don't even read the dialogs that appear in the product. Every single day, people on my product team *waste* over 30 hours combined just walking people through installs. How hard is an install? ""Next. Next. Next. Enter your name. Next. Alright, that's everything.""


* **Don't open a case you're not ready to work on.** Protip kids: Don't open a new technical ticket with your IT person at 4:50 on Friday. Or the day before your vacation. Or a ""proactive case"" just in case you need assistance with an upgrade. Open a case when you need help now, and you're ready to work on it now. Imagine if your boss came to you and said ""I need you to prepare a big presentation for someone important. It has to be done in three days; but I'm not telling you what the presentation is about or your audience. Get to work."" *That* is what your tickets you're not actually working on feel like to us.

In my opinion it doesn't really make sense to say that you want less of a specific tile though.

In terms of doing new things with portals, I would love to see some more innovative uses of portals in map submissions as well, but it's hard for mapmakers to use them correctly since aside from NF maps, no maps really use them in rotation, so there's little room for inspiration from already existing maps, and in general, the opinion we see in the limelight (on the sub, mumble and in PUBs) seems to be somewhat negative which I imagine dissaudes at least a few mapmakers from doing some experimenting with them as an element.",false,false,t1_cmcs2mg,DaEvil1,DaEvil1,0,1416939329,t5_2w7hh,t3_2ncxwm,t1_cmcln57,-1,1425845691,0,0,cmcs2mg,TagPro,-1,,,

"Assuming we're looking for a backup big (which we can debate if we want but I think it makes by far the most sense) and assuming Joel Embiid doesn't fall to us, which, you know, would be alright, I think Willie Cauley-Stein could be a serious possibility, even though most mock drafts have him a few picks higher, with Patric Young as another maybe even more realistic option for a backup big. Another possibility, maybe even more realistic than we want to think about right now, is that, if Darren Collison cashes in on his one-year minimum gamble and goes somewhere else, we need a backup point guard.

"I never claimed that the Kinsey scale was intended to prove that people could change in their sexuality. I used it as proof that sexuality is a complex issue and that reality is not digital. ""reality is much more gray than black or white. So is sexuality. Look up the Kinsey scale."" That was my claim with regards to the Kinsey scale. You seem to agree with that claim. Good. Let's continue.

I NEVER used the terms rape or childhood abuse except when I pointed out that rape was NOT what I was talking about. Again, you ignore what I'm saying. I gave you A FULL PARAGRAPH to point out that I wasn't talking about rape. I didn't use those terms because they don't describe what I meant at all, although I will agree that ""they radically alter the whole person."" That's going off on a tangent because again, it's not what I'm necessarily talking about.

When I said abuse, I spoke not only of sexual abuse but of physical abuse in general and also psychological/verbal abuse. For example, male persons this sub might refer to in jest as a ""low-test beta faggot"" are intimidated by other people, especially women. I again don't have any formal evidence to hand you, but I believe a glimpse inside American middle and high schools can illustrate how social interactions can cause such submissive patterns to evolve in young males. I've met many young men who associated females with (aggressively) dominant roles because they were treated like shit by them in middle and/or high school, and then went on to derive sexual enjoyment from that hierarchy. There's nothing wrong with that, I'm just explaining how this sort of thing happens. Childhood experiences affect humans psychologically over the long term, and we've known this for decades. What I'm saying is that homosexuality is another facet of this relationship.

I never said that the body shuts down due to sexual assault! I said that, ""Your body can tell the difference between a violent touch and consensual touch,"" which is exactly true. I said nothing of any organ system other than the skin which perceives TOUCH and is perfectly capable of distinguishing pain from pleasure or neutral pressure. This logic is of a totally different train of thought than the retarded notion that pregnancy can be averted during rape. 

""Look up any medical or psychological society with merit and you will see they each one rejects the idea that you can change orientation.""
1. I never said that one can change their orientation. Perhaps you should study English a little and learn the difference between the subject of a sentence and the object of a sentence. I claim that orientation is subject to certain amounts change during childhood and that their capacity for change lessens as time goes on. That is much different than saying one may change orientations by their own will.
2. I refuse to accept your pseudo-evidence any longer. Either provide actual studies or statements by recognized scientific communities or use logic and observation in order to argue your beliefs further.

I disagree that you are capable of the empathy to say why ""most people"" engage in sexual interaction only with their preferred gender. You can't read minds and I can't either.

Furthermore, you keep talking about love. To quote Stefan Molyneux, ""Love is an involuntary response to virtue in another person."" Every other feeling is something else: religious infatuation(puppy love), biological attachment(mother and young child), or sexual attraction. All of these emotions are capable of standing apart from each other, including love and sexual attraction.

I'd also like to clarify that I never said HOW fluid sexuality is. I'm of the common opinion that it's a little more fluid for women than it is for men, but that's yet another tangent. I couldn't quantify this sort of thing

Point is, I CAN'T advocate for every red piller to be homosexual because that would be like telling an atheist to go Christian. It isn't a conscious decision that can be made, as I'm sure you'll agree. And I WOULDN'T advocate for that anyway because I don't agree with that view point at all. I WILL advocate that any RP man who has bisexual tendencies explore them if he can do so in reasonable safety from medical issues or legions of born-again Christians wielding torches.

As for the very last phrase of your comment, I think that's important that you said that. If you ask me, TRP often gets tunnel vision and newcomers especially think that it's about sex. That isn't the primary intent. It's about how to interact with immature people, especially immature women. Some TRP-goers fall into the trap of thinking that all women are immature because of the association they see on here, and of course that isn't true. It's damn close, but it's not totally true. Both males and females exhibit dangerously high levels of stupid, but on TRP we usually only talk about how to deal with the female brand of stupid, which is probably why people think we hate women. We don't.

Back to the main argument, though, I feel like you are misunderstanding my hypothesis. Let me lay it out for you in the best language I can so that this doesn't continue to happen.

Being gay is not a conscious choice any more than it is a biological imperative. While genetic information can alter the chances of being homosexual and perhaps the extent to which one is homosexual, there is no on/off switch that decides the issue when the child is born. Rather, a combination of biological issues and psychological ideas come together to influence the ""final"" shape of an individual's sexuality, including their gender orientation. ""Final"" is in quotes because the human psyche is ever-changing, but the hypothesis also claims that the capacity for that change or pliability (when it comes to sexuality) diminishes over time. 

As I said, this is a hypothesis. I'm not claiming this as absolute fact any more than an atheist claims his disbelief in god is a fact. I'm simply saying that observations of reality point to this as being the nature of the beast and that this is how I'm going to view the issue unless I encounter powerful evidence against it.",false,true,t1_cgh37vj,Prometheus720,,0,1396325535,t5_2ve1u,t3_21qtkm,t1_cggdobu,1,1433157952,0,0,cgh37vj,TheRedPill,1,,,

"Welcome to the sub!  Or your first post lol

I just posted about this, but for one, you SHOULD be stretching but avoid doing static stretches. Static meaning you are in a position, stretching the muscles and holding for a period of time. This is actually considered **bad** to do **before** a run. There are a lot of scientific reasons for it, but the main one is because it over stretches the muscles and tendons. It makes them loose.. which in turns puts more pressure on your joints and over stresses other muscles. SOME level of tightness is required. This is why you should do **dynamic** stretches. For optimal results, you should do dynamic stretches after a good brisk warmup. Things like squats, or anything that extends the muscle in the position it's going to be running, but without **holding** it in a stretching position. Do some research online about this, and I think you will find some interesting things.

[Check this out](http://running.competitor.com/2014/07/injury-prevention/dynamic-stretching-vs-static-stretching_54248) if you haven't already!

&gt;Do you guys carry water with you when you run? I always try to make sure I'm hydrated before I go out, but I don't bring a water bottle with me or anything. I'm worried that I'll get into trouble during the longer runs later in the program.

I also just posted about this in another thread, so copy and paste for the win!  Now, about hydration. You don't need to worry yourself so much about dehydrating in 20 minutes. Realistically and scientifically it's nearly impossible to do if you are well hydrated before and after your run. You won't need to concern yourself with needing to drink while running, and all it may do is give you side aches. Stay hydrated an hour before your run. Don't guzzle. Remember an average person sweats out 27-42 oz of water PER HOUR. I can drink a single 24 oz bottle of water in a single sitting.

So believe me, as long as you weren't dehydrated before going in to your run, you aren't going to kill over. There are just too many people freaked out about hydration and in actuality there are a LOT of people OVER hydrating. I personally keep track of mine with my FitBit app so I know how much water I have or haven't consumed throughout the day.

There's also a fish named Candiruaçu who is larger and feed from meat of other fishes, he makes a hole on the fish and eat him inside-out.

No real problem with any of that. The important thing is that all of the kosher rules are followed, which is definitely easier in an all vegetarian kitchen.

There is a potential issue of ""maris ayin"" which means ""appearance of the eye."" If someone were to see you put parve cheese on a meat burger, some people might think that it's actual cheese, which would give them the impression that a cheeseburger is kosher. 

I don't think the same concerns would apply if all of the food is vegetarian but just happens to kind of look like meat.

This is important because both flying and not flying are positive decisions to act in our personal lives.  Now consider the instruction:


Proof beyond a reasonable doubt requires such proof as would convince you of the truth of a fact to the extent that you would be willing to act upon such belief without reservation in an important matter in your own business or personal affairs.

"I don't know, I do feel like he's projecting onto her because of his depression but I don't feel that it's coming from a place of malice or even blame. Maybe he's just in a really hopeless place and he needs help and support in a different way than she's giving, but he doesn't know how to ask. Maybe he expected things to turn around for him when he found work and now that he has and they haven't he's feeling frustrated and lost and he's (wrongfully) laying those feelings on her.

I'd be willing to bet that there's other feelings at play here that he's having a hard time expressing. It's been proven that exercise can be a crucial stepping stone to overcoming depression, and logically I'm sure he understands this, so maybe going to the gym has been something that he's had to really force himself to do, and the fact that she's more or less indifferent to it is making him feel like she's indifferent to his recovery, which is a much bigger betrayal. I think he needs her to take the lead on this, and the fact that she doesn't seem interested is creating issues for him. 

I think OP's partner is just looking for a different kind of support than she's been giving him and he's probably in a pretty hopeless state of mind. It's not okay how he's treating her, that's for sure, but maybe she just needs to step back and say ""You know what, this isn't about me. Let's talk about what's really going on and what you really need from me"". Maybe he needs her to haul his ass out of bed every now and then and force him to go to the gym. When he lashes out at her, and she takes the fight bait things escalate it gives him an easier way to expess his frustrations without actually addressing his feelings of helplessness. Nobody likes to admitt when they feel helpless.

Also, I know that the issues here extend well beyond the gym, its was just easier to cite the one example since I feel what I'm describing easily applies to all of the issues. He say's she's not close enough to his family, when really maybe he fears that he's drifted and it would be easier to maintain close ties if they do it together, etc.

OP's partner is going through a really hard time in his life. He's pursuing counselling for both of them and even though they probably have more hard times ahead I really do think he's trying to keep it together. He's feeling uncertain about himself which naturally translates into uncertainty about them as a couple. They just need to get the communication thing down. He's picking at things that aren't actually the issue and instead of sitting him down for a calm conversation about what is the issue, she's freakig out and yelling at him about it. He needs her to take the lead here, but instead they're both just running around yelling ""fire!""",false,false,t1_cmyoak4,Irisversicolor,,0,1418920459,t5_2qjvn,t3_2plx2k,t1_cmydfg5,15,1425335652,0,0,cmyoak4,relationships,15,,,

"Most weapons these days are implosion type plutonium devices. Gun type uranium fission weapons are what you're thinking of in that exact description, but you have the idea correct. Explosive lenses direct a compression wave inward which compresses a small sphere (or football) and ignites a nuclear chain reaction. In a thermonuclear weapon much of the hard radiation (x/gamma) is transferred through a 'spark plug' and into a fusion secondary stage which is also compressed by the first fission explosion. Ironically, fusion weapons are much cleaner than fission weapons when it comes to fallout. Tsar Bomba, the biggest nuke ever, was a three stage fusion device if I remember correctly. You also want to detonate the weapon in an 'airburst' ideally as this will better spread the explosive force leading to more destruction than if it had detonated on the ground. 

What could have happened was that the safety devices in place to prevent the detonation of the high explosive could have failed resulting in a nuclear detonation. ",false,false,t1_cm6z0lx,reddittrees2,,0,1416408476,t5_2qqjc,t3_2mre64,t1_cm6v7at,9,1425949309,0,0,cm6z0lx,todayilearned,9,,,

What bugs me about that is, how did Kakashi get the Sharingans? Probably due to Obito's spirit-chakra. But how did he do that? Did he just decide in the afterlife ""Oh, I still gotta go back, without any preperation, sorry Rin, brb."" I bet Kakashi could've done NOTHING from the limbo-esque world that you mentioned. The only way this would work is if Obito did some jutsu like Dan before he died and Kishimoto did not show it for dramatic effect and the methaphorical ""warp out of the afterlife"", which would be fine if he showed that Obito actually used such a jutsu later on.

Although all [U.S. customary units](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_customary_units) have been redefined in terms of SI units, the [United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States) does not commonly mandate the use of SI. This, according to the CIA Factbook, makes the US one of only three countries (alongside [Burma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burma) and [Liberia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberia)) that have not adopted the metric system as their official system of weights and measures.

"I realise I'm getting down voted to hell here, but if you all agree that

then I wholeheartedly invite you to try it out for yourself. But remember, even motorcycle helmets are only designed to protect the head from impacts up to 13 mph (basically the force of falling off and hitting your head on the pavement). 

It's great that Beth Harden survived her fall. But using it to argue that a skateboard helmet will 'surely' save you from a brain injury in a 30 foot fall is like saying 'my grandmother smoked like a trooper until she was 85, how can cigarettes be dangerous!'.

"For Phasewalker, essentially it comes down to min-maxing and making the most efficient usage of your time. When you spend less time recalling, you get back to lane faster and you miss less minions. On champions who aren't very mana-hungry (ie. Annie for me) I like to take 3 points of Fleet of Foot and 1 point of Phasewalker. The mana regeneration is great if you need it, but it is not as good compared to movespeed as a combat stat. I actually wouldn't take Phasewalker over Fleet of Foot, though, as the extra ms makes up the difference in recall time.

For biscuits vs buff duration, it really comes down to whether or not you expect to get blue buff. If you are going to have blue, the buff duration does a lot for you.

"What /u/superkarmah is saying is that the test server is what is causing the speed differential.

You can see this yourself with www.speedtest.net. Run the test once using the closest server to you. Then run it again using a server that's far away (try one a couple thousand miles away for example). You will probably see a change in latency and speed. This is because the data has to travel a longer distance and through more hops / transfer points before it gets to/from its destination. 

Therefore - XB1 might be using a server for speed tests that is geographically closer to you, or otherwise technologically more direct (meaning the data passes on a more direct or less resistant path to the server) than the PS4 test server. 

In reality, it's just a test - and the ""test server"" may perform very different from actual use (for example - speed relationship to a test server might be substantially slower than speed relationship to say, Netflix, for example). Hence why connection speeds are estimates only. It is possible that for some reason or another the Sony test servers are consistently slow (MS has a much more substantial cloud offering for enterprise and consumer use - so it might mean they have higher server capacity for this sort of thing).

"Awesome I'm a lefty too. 

First I think you should try tossing the ball slightly higher maybe around 6 inches. Make sure you're making contact as high as you can reach. 

Also you really should try adding a slice or top spin serve. at first you'll be poor at it but it's definitely something you want in your game.  For the slice just try hitting the outside of the ball. 

I think for practice you should try serving without jumping sometimes. This simplifies the serve and you can focus on your swing more rather than your legs. 

Once you get the swing and contact down then add the jump. And for when you're jumping (this is for lefties) 

Deuce side: you should finish in front of the line and towards your left slightly. almost like you're jumping towards the left post. 

Ad side: jump forward in front of the line. you wouldn't want to jump towards the right because that results in an imbalance

"This is the thing. It was 30 years ago, and all I have are memories of the incident itself and how quickly it was glossed over and forgotten about. Documentation, all of it, is completely untraceable. The school no longer has the records of former pupils, and I personally would rather it was forgotten about. I was the perpetrator, and my mother has since passed away from cancer a few years ago.  So, all I am saying is what you see in the media is if anything just the tip of a horrifically big iceberg. 

The UK government always places anything it perceives as a risk to National Security above the law, and thus will bend and skirt around those laws as best they can to protect a higher asset such as a government minister.

"Alright, I just looked at the match info that you provided in your other comment. From what I can tell, the game snowballed out of control when Draven got a triple kill at dragon. Did you start that dragon? Either way, when bot lane snowballs like that, you should consider yourself to be at a disadvantage on that half of the map. Even though (it looks like) Rek'Sai roamed to the dragon to give a 5v4 advantage, you weren't able to deal with Draven, and he snowballed and carried from there.

When a lane snowballs like that, try to either make a decision to either shut down the snowballing early (by camping the lane, though this is risky in low elos as your teammates may not be on the same page as you, and you could give their lane even more kills) or to focus your attention elsewhere (I believe that this would have been the best decision).

"(Note, this is the first time I played with formatting, I kinda made this a disaster)

Well, I'm not sure where you're from, I grew up in a very rural area, and moving to Brooklyn was quite a change.  This is how I pretty much live my life (but of course *everyone* is different).  Remember, I like to completely pack my week with VERY little uncertainty and always make sure my next week is full before the weekend.

**Regular Weekday**

* Wake up at 6:55am
* I start a kettle and use a Chemex to brew coffee I bought for $20/pound from some local artisanal coffee roaster.
* I open up a computer, catch up on Reddit, save what I want to read to Pocket so I can read it on the train with no internet.
* I realize it's somehow 9am and I have 20 minutes to get dressed to get work at 10am for my 10:15 standup (I work at a tech startup).
* If I decide to bring my dog to work (I work at a tech dog startup), I shove her in an Etsy tote bag (I have plenty of tote bags)
* I walk 2 blocks to the train, take the train and head to Chinatown, which takes about 30-35 minutes depending on how the N is running on that given day.
* I work , order lunch from Seamless, usually Gobo or S'nice, work for a few more hours and leave work around 6:30-7:30.
* What I do next is completely dependant on what day of the week it is:
* **Monday** - I meet with a group of friends in DUMBO and throw around business/investment ideas and hack for a few hours.
* **Tuesday** / Wildcard day - I use this day to meet with people for dinner
* **Wednesday** - Archery, I go to staten island and shoot at targets
* **Thursday** - Every odd Thursday I go to Brooklyn Heights and attend a Toastmasters Meeting.  Even Thursdays, this is used as a wildcard day.
* **Friday** - Date night, my dedicated night to hang out with my wife. Our dates are usually:
* Movies at the IFC or Nitehawk
* Food at places like Dirt Candy
 
**Weekend**

* **Saturday** 
* Brunch, I wake up late, around 9am and sit around the apt and wait for 11am to grab brunch.  Brunch places we hit: Champs Family Bakery, Clementine Bakery, or sometimes, we actually cook at home.
Saturday is a day I spend completely with my wife, so we do things like: Go to MoMA (we're members), go to some weird class like screen printing, bring our dog to agility training, go to the Brooklyn Flea, roam Greenpoint, hit Bluebottle, etc etc.
* **Sunday** - Personal Workday - I work on my side projects on Sunday, I go to DUMBO where I rent a shared office space and work for the day.

**Other**

* We travel to Woodstock, NY a lot and rent cottages, we're planning on buying land up there. 
* We go to the Farm Sanctuary upstate a bunch.
* Cooking at home is a rare event, but if I decide to cook I drive to Fairway in Red Hook, or most recently the Whole Foods in BK and buy a bunch of local artisan vegan yuppy stuff.

"It could lead to some frustration, but that will apply to any and all skill improvements.

Reload improvement? He reloaded faster, that's unfair.

Stamina improvement? He can run faster/further than me, that's unfair.

Health improvement? He survived more shots than me, that's unfair.

Any skill/point based advantage will create some situations where that skill can/will save a player. An advantage is supposed to be advantageous.

The problem is making the advantage discreet, and still reliant on player skill. Using reloading speed as an example:

Current reload speed is base. Purely from memory, my numbers may be off here, but **say an M4 takes roughly 4 seconds to reload.**

Now, if I spend X amount of time (for argument's sake 24 hours lived in game) my character loses .25 seconds on his reload time. Up to a maximum of 5 times.

At the maximum level, my character will be able to reload in 2.75 seconds instead of 4 seconds. A 1.25 second difference.

Any gunfight is still going to rely on player positioning, player accuracy, and player tactics. The player will still need to choose the right time to reload.

The number of instances when the fact that the player can reload 1.25 seconds faster actually makes an impact on a firefight? Negligible. Hell, I've so far played 96 hours of DayZ and I've had 2 instances where I've had to reload mid firefight - both of which involved me taking cover for a significant timeframe. Would my reloading 1.25 seconds faster have impacted the firefight at all? No. Am I going to care about not being able to reload faster if/when I die? Yes.",false,true,t1_cf4tylk,PyroDragn,,0,1391309714,t5_2ty3s,t3_1wrcac,t1_cf4qqhl,3,1432212935,0,0,cf4tylk,dayz,3,,,
"The last time something added to the game changed it was in beta 1.3 when beds were implemented (if you care for exploration, beta 1.8 changed that too, for the worst). Since then I basically ignored most of the changes introduced in the game for the simple reason nothing forced me to change. I usually give it a try for a while then forget about it (hunger, you say? I used to grow and eat food before, no big deal). Basically that's the opposite of ""game changing"", so I agree with you on that.

IMO this game lacks an actual game designer so it's only founded on emergent gameplay. That turns devs into content providers for the real designers: the crowd. I'm not saying this it necessarily a bad thing but it prevents them from doing anything game changing.

"This basically.  

If you are unable to sight-read to a decent extent, these exercises aren't going to be very helpful. You must be able to take in a large amount of musical information, recognize common patterns, and be able to execute them with a rhythmic, pulse with a sense of continuity and the larger line. 

If most of your reading is at the level where you are taking things note by note, and executing them finger by finger, these exercises will just frustrate you. 

At least on the technical front, (and not on a musical front), I think a student should at least be able to know exactly how to go about and what to feel and hear to at least get Chopin's Op 10, no 1, 2, and 7 near up to tempo with absolute control. 

They don't actually have to have the those pieces finished, but they should at least be able to get certain key measures down and be able to transpose them.  And speaking of not necessarily having those pieces  completely down actually, I think a student should also be able to know the musical and technical concerns of something like Godowsky-Chopin Study 45.  They don't have to have it down because it takes an incredible amount of work, but if they know exactly how to go about learning it, then these exercises will become much more useful.

"I would say you've made the claim too vague. If you mean that it is different from ISIS, Al Qaeda, or other terrorists groups, then certainly these are different, especially Ottawa. I can speak more to the Ottawa one since I live here and kept up with the details.

There is no question he was a troubled youth with at least some form of personality disorder, as described by several people in his past. He was also a drug addict, trying to get Corrections Canada to pay for his rehab by committing crimes (by his own admission in his prior attempt), got kicked out of a Mosque for his behaviour, and tried to get his passport to go to the Middle East -- not to fight as a terrorist, but to study Islam. 

So no, he was fits no description of what we mean by a terrorist. He wasn't trying to further some ideological or political agenda; he wasn't a member or connected to any terrorist group in any way; he didn't act to create terror by attacking the public. He was acting for attention and just wanted help for his own personal troubles. For all of that, there is little objection I've seen. (Though, some people still want to assign the term *terrorist* for some self-serving reason that I don't understand.)

However, part of his problems included the contrast between his faith in Islam and his drug addiction, and his goal in traveling to the Middle East was to study Islam, for which he seemed to have mostly run out of options. So it may not be fair to say it had *nothing* to do with Islam, but rather than Islam was somewhat incidental to his actions. It isn't something *unique* to Islam, or driven by dogma contain within Islam. I would say you may be technically wrong, but for all pragmatic intents and purposes your approximation is reasonable.

I don't know as much about the Australian incident or background, but since they were asking for ISIS flags, it seems that they were at least driven somewhat by support to Islamic causes. It seems less incidental than the Ottawa case, so perhaps harder to argue. I would agree they were not what we mean by Islamist terrorists, and hardly come close, but Islam certainly has *something* to do with their actions, even if not the main explanation.

They aren't receiving much free money from each sale at this point. They still put a good amount of effort into their releases (which actually outweighs their profits), and you can read a bit about what that includes here: http://wiiudaily.com/2013/06/wii-u-virtual-console-flaws/

Its a different type of market. Without people willing to pay these prices (and there obviously are, otherwise the prices wouldn't be the way they are), Nintendo wouldn't be here how they are today. Same goes for Sony and Microsoft's gaming division.

On this note, I do find the price of NES/SNES games a tad alarming. I could see N64 games being priced at $10 because they're more recent and a lot of kids grew up on them. But the NES/SNES games being $5 - $8? Sounds insane other than for true classics. People still regularly play the Gamecube, so thats one reason why I'm fine with paying $20~ for those titles.

"&gt; HowToTopLane is not talking about LCS meta, and I didn't directly say I have success in my role, but I had it with non meta champs.

You can argue semantics all you want. This was a thread regarding pro players disliking their role. Your argument was, 'I (a non-pro player)have had success with non meta champs in solo queue, therefore players who dislike the meta just haven't tried enough non meta champs.' 

If you'd like to respond, please tell me in a simple yes or no format if that was your argument. If yes, I think you can agree how idiotic that sounds now that I've spelled it out. If it's not your argument, you may want to go back and look at the words that you typed and the order that you used them in, because if it wasn't your argument then I don't possibly know what you intended to say. 

&gt; You do realize every single point you brought up is retarded, right?

Uhmmmm, I brought up one point. So not multiple ones as you claim...Perhaps you could expand on why I'm wrong about your non-professional solo queue experiences being relevant here.

"A worm hole is a “tube made of spacetime” that connects two different regions.  If it’s set up right, you could enter one side of the tube and exit the other end somewhere else, or even somewhen else.  In contrast, a black hole destroys the hell out of things, and doesn’t “go anywhere”.

A worm hole is a funnel (what’s shown here is only a two dimensional funnel) that tapers down to a “throat” (which although thinner never pinches off entirely) which connects to another funnel that opens up somewhere else.  A black hole is a funnel that pinches off at a singularity.  A traversable worm hole needs to be large and “mellow” enough that it doesn’t have an event horizon (a black hole’s “point of no return”), or any fatal tidal forces.

"If i remember correctly there were a few instances like one where a British soldier charged a German trench alone and overrun them quite quickly.  They all surrendered but was patting him on the back and congratulating him for it, as they were very impressed by what he had done. 

I enjoy hearing about these humane moments in wartime.  It's easy to villainize the enemy.

I think one of the best was when the German filter pilot escorted a critically damaged allied bomber across the border. . The German pilot was astounded at the damage the bomber took and refused to engage it in combat.  So he led it to safety.

Many decades later the two pilots found each other through an ad in the paper I believe.  Became good friends after that. 

With the villanization of a nations enemies, it's easy to forget that there are some normal people in the mix.

"Definitely push to be a server off the bat IF possible, but take what you can get. You will earn quite a bit more money as a server in NYC fine dining than in any other position, service captain/sommeliers notwithstanding. It's not unheard of to graduate to server from host or busser, but it is rare and a lot of places will just pick up experienced servers from outside when they find themselves short of staff - there are a lot of servers in Manhattan, obviously.

Host pay varies quite a bit. Many places start out at around $11-$12 an hour, and it does not improve significantly until you get up the food chain. My current restaurant, for example, pays between $18-$20 an hour. Not bad as a second job or as a student, but not enough to live comfortably for sure. Oftentimes, I've seen hosts move up to more administrative positions that often come with pay raises, (rarely) benefits, and significantly better working hours.

"You've never had a bad day?  You've never had an outburst? You've always acted **exactly** as someone expects of you?  

All the reasons for his actions are there.  They are all within the character we know.  Aggression for him is always when his loved ones are threatened. All he has in the world is the people he considers his friends. He could see that was getting taken away from him. He was getting shoved out of the group *and* members of the group were being physically threatened. He reacted in anger. 

He's done it before.  You know.  Having emotions outside of sadness or obliviousness.

He didn't stay that way. It wasn't like he shifted into a crabby lobster guy forever.  He forcefully reclaimed his spot as the walking pair of scissor hands.  After normal was re-established, he calmed down by the next episode and it went back to normal for him.  

Sometimes the pacifist fights back. Sometimes the smart guy doesn't have the answers. Sometimes the womanizer doesn't get the girl. Sometimes an asshole does something nice. Sometimes the painfully optimistic one gets mad.

That's what happens when you develop a full character. They ... like real living people-type people ... will sometimes act in ways you don't expect.

I'm not observant enough to tell you what it was exactly that turned me off and made the game such a task to enjoy, but it likely was a combination of a confusing UI, confusing quest lines, confusing combat, annoying and unnecessary camera cuts during conversations, and dying a lot.

"&gt; feminism has been making strong and steady social progress for years now and that hasn't changed.

2 of the 3 big accomplishments achieved by feminists that I can think of predate the 60s; suffrage and the right to work.  But the only other one I can think of is the recognition of martial rape which in the US was definitely a feminist cause (although one they were pretty slow on) and the only recent accomplishment that comes to mind.

Have feminist done much since the 60s/70s cusp?  I know there have been a lot of feminists doing stuff, but I mean accomplishments that can be attributed to more then a natural result of the enfranchisement of women where feminist groups lobbied or campaigned for and then won specific measurable change.

&gt; if you think constructive conversation about both women's and men's issues isn't happening

I'm not speaking for anyone else but I don't think feminism is good at promoting constructive conversation, nor are any other identity politics.  Feminist surely are capable but when constructive conversation does happen it does so despite the elephant in the room that if certain things are touched on they can quickly derail any conversation unless it's happening between people of the same gender, racial and socioeconomic background with similar physical histories, etc.  Because that's what identity politics does and feminism was, in a way, poisoned by identity politics a long time ago.

And speaking of only online, weren't the disagreements between feminists like 70 years ago basically the exact same ones of today?  Didn't some feminists attack the WCWA, which was run by other feminists, for promoting the same ideas people bicker about today regarding women's agency and didn't feminists back then have the same issues with minorities between the NWP and NAWSA and sex positivity vs negativity and whether or not femininity is natural or social and whether or not masculinity is natural or social, etc?  I read Mary Ritter Beard's history and it was like reading gender drama on reddit only almost 70 years ago and sent through a Ye' Olde English filter.

The atmosphere isn't completely none existent even at LEO which is why there actually is some energy loss over time and course correction is needed for satellites. Also the earth isn't uniformly shaped (not a sphere) which throws off the orbit a bit when there is a change of gravity due to this mass differential say at the equator where the earth bulges out.",false,false,t1_cn5xnyj,SipTime,,0,1419620521,t5_2qh1i,t3_2qfwko,t1_cn5vz0t,1,1425207411,0,0,cn5xnyj,AskReddit,1,,,

"Growing up, my oldest brother was very much like our father in the emotions department - not necessarily void of emotions, but much more stoic and logical, whereas I've always been very open with my emotions. We got along quite well, despite that difference. Anyway...

In February 2013 I was raped by his roommate at a party they held. It was after mostly everyone had left, so when I broke free and ran to my brother, only a few people were left. My brother's best friend reacted with anger, running about the entire neighborhood out for blood. My brother, however, was his very logical self: let's get you home, we'll call the police, get you to the hospital, etc. He was obviously in a bit of shock but still level headed. 

Until we got home, that is. I pardoned myself to call my then-boyfriend, who was out of town, when suddenly my brother comes into my room and just breaks down in a way I had never seen him do before, even when our beloved grandmother passed away. He was a wreck, hugging me so tight, sobbing about how he couldn't believe that happened and ""I'm so sorry how could I let this happen?"" I was a mess as well, crying that it wasn't his fault and I was going to be okay. It was a very out of character moment for him, and one I'll never forget. 

So yeah, maybe most other responses here will end in ""And that's how I learned my sibling was a douche,"" but not mine. I love my brother so much. ",false,false,t1_cn5xv3e,thuggithruggith,,0,1419620973,t5_2qh1i,t3_2qgr4c,t3_2qgr4c,2,1425207318,0,0,cn5xv3e,AskReddit,2,,,

"&gt; The negativity in you is strong

It is. That's because I've been watching the Cowboys for the entire Jerry Jones era and they've turned into a sort of monkey's paw team. It's like dealing with a mischievous genie. Want a successful offense? Great, done, now your secondary can't defend a QB if they're throwing trash bag full of discarded wrapping paper. Want a good draft for once? Great, here, now the best player from that draft has legs made of ceramic and ligaments of tissue paper.

&gt;We might not look great winning but we're still a decent team who can give any team a run for their money. I come in thinking we can win every game, doesn't matter who the team is.

Well, yeah, that's because of how the NFL is structured. There are a few good teams, and a few really really bad teams, and everyone else is fully capable of beating the other teams if they get a few breaks.

In the Cowboys' case, though, I can't imagine any QB who can fog a mirror not having a career day this season. The 2-1 record is largely due to facing Jake Locker and whoever the Rams' QB is.

"What do you define as ""game breaking""? If it's a bug that happens once in a while and maybe ruins 0.001% of games then it probably isn't game breaking so it won't have priority. But if everyone knows about the bug and abuses it, and if it ruins lets say 10% of the games then it's quite a big thing, therefore probably game breaking and will be fixed soon...

So if you acknowledge that a game breaking bug gets fixed then you must also acknowledge that if we spread the information of a bug around so much that it becomes game breaking it will also get fixed sooner. The mere fact that it's spread and abused so much makes it game breaking and you yourself confirmed that game breaking bugs get fixed. So yes, posts like that do matter and they do force Valve to react and fix those issues. It could be argued that it's bad for Valve because it forces them to work and fix certain things.

Hey guys,

As part of a project I'm doing in preparation for university, I've made a series of bookmarks to sell.

They are printed on gloss paper and then laminated.  I made these myself and there might be small deviation in the white and laminated borders. The size is approximately 20.6cm x 4.7cm.

The Bookmarks feature notable units in WW2 (with exception of the 13th Roman Legion and Mass Effect one).

They can be obtained here:

"Not a cashier but a courtesy clerk.

Here's three of my favorite stories.

Once a lady was buying herpe cream and the way she bought it was priceless. She loaded her groceries and last minute pulled it from underneath her purse and covered it completely with her hand, then she looked the cashier dead in the eye and reached over, scanned the item herself and put it back in her purse. The rest of the process was just purely awkward. I'm surprised someone would be so embarrassed about that.

Another time a man had purchased some condoms and lube. About an hour later he came back and returned them with the biggest look of defeat on his face.

Third one was when a large man walked in and was asking for a certain condom, he was complaining that all the ones we had for sale were all too big (which is bizarre, I thought most condoms could fit even the smallest penis). Anyway, he was not ashamed to start making a fuss about how our store discriminates against tiny penises and we should sell condoms for all sizes, not just giant penises.

"As an America, I think you'd recognize how slow and hard it is to make political change, considering your political parties are stagnating and making no progress.  

The Germany Army had strict troop control levels in place for a very long time.  Plus, we integrated a whole separate military that fought on the opposite side only 20 years ago. Oh, and we spent trillions of dollars bringing East Germany back to being part of our country because it was stolen from us by the USSR.  I'm still waiting to get back Königsberg, but that's another story.

Nationalism and a strong military is still very frowned upon in Germany, and it's just now starting to regain support.  In some parts of Germany, waving a German flag will get you beaten up by leftists because they consider that fascist.  It's still a huge taboo, I shit you not.  There's actually a video of Merkel telling a German politician to put away a German flag he was waving.  It was literally like 3 inches big.  So you take into consideration all of that and a culture being against using military force, you get a difficult political situation.

But I would love for us to build a large military and kick your country out.  You spy on our leaders and have huge military bases here.  How is that not an occupation?  In fact, I'd love for Europe to be completely independent of US protection altogether.

However, as long as the US is willing to pay for our security, Europeans are too focused on other political issues.  We will complain about you, then ask for your help when we need it.

"That you don't have to try to fit in. In most cases I feel that individuality is frowned upon. You go through school, and everyone is striving to be the same, and in a way, those are the people with more opportunity. The ones who can fit in don't have to try as hard because they can rest knowing that the pressure won't be on them. I hate to see all the individuality go to waste, just because that person is afraid that they won't be accepted. It infuriates me to see how open to close-mindedness society has become. I hate being hated for not wanting to be just another face in a crowd. I see it even in this reddit community, if you don't share the same opinions as the circlejerk than you are shunned and downvoted to oblivion. People have become so sensitive and close-minded, that if you do not share the same belief, then you can suffer from some serious consequences. I know it is cliche, but life is short, too short to bring people down for not thinking in the same mind-frame as you.

"The arena is good for learning the basic motion, but as soon as you've got that down, move into a practice match. Firstly so that you get used to playing with the camera angle that you're actually going to be using, secondly because the key to actually beating people with skills is knowing when to use them, in terms of distance/position compared to a defender.

The other major thing is that some skills are more useful than others, and much easier to do reliably. For example, the roulette is really easy to reliably pull off, and very useful if a defender is charging in at you. The skills that are easiest to do reliably (assuming they're also useful), are the ones to focus on, and the ones you'll see used the most.

"&gt; I know that Moyles is dealing in a far larger sum of money and perhaps he should have been more careful. I think if I were in his shoes I would have done a very similar thing.

One of the principles for tax law is whether what you did was reasonable for a reasonable man.  This means it doesn't have to be right, but it does have to be reasonable.  

You inherit from this a variety of responsibilities.  On the simple end you're expected to ensure that your agent, if you use one, is provided with all your relevant records.  And that you make him aware of anything he needs to know.  

It's partly circumstantial, so if you run a small business and sell a second-hand sewing machine you used in the business for £50 you won't be expected to take specialist advice.  If on the other hand you sell a factory for £50million, it *is* expected that a reasonable man would seek advice to ensure he gets the transactional consequences right.

In all absolute seriousness do you think that he behaved reasonably when he claimed to have been trading in used cars, despite having trading income of just £3,827 **and** that after a bit of jiggery pokery with loan contracts he made a loss of £1,000,159?

On top of this, you should consider this:  When the case was to be taken to the Tax Tribunal he made an **[application to have the hearing in secret](http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/money/tax/article3605510.ece)**.  He did so on the grounds that it would infringe his HRA rights and harm his earning potential.

So you have a man who entered into a scheme whose reality was beyond flimsy and who knew full well that being seen to have used the scheme would have a dramatically negative effect on his public image.

When you think about the things your accountant pointed out you were entitled to claim, can you think of a single one that you'd be afraid to admit to because people would be sufficiently appalled so as to not employ or buy from you?

These people know full well what they're doing when they use these schemes.  ",false,true,t1_cfll42h,Cast_Me-Aside,Yorkshire,0,1393041911,t5_2qhqb,t3_1yjxy3,t1_cfle46g,11,1432505678,0,0,cfll42h,unitedkingdom,11,,eng-yorkshire,

"&gt;...even though she's been dragging me through the process from start to finish. Well... not dragging exactly, I've gone along with it of my own accord. But I have done so because she wanted it.

There's no one to blame but yourself here.  You are an adult.  It takes many steps to purchase a home and you had many opportunities to back out.  Begin learning to be more assertive about your own feelings.  At this point I'm sure that you know the significant financial and tax advantages of home ownership over renting, so try to focus on the silver lining, not the cloud.

&gt;I was happy...having a room of my own to build my home studio in, working my job, and playing my instruments.

Not really sure how owning a home prevents any of this.  Most people buy homes larger than an apartment.  If a home studio is important to you, once again, you need to be assertive and communicate that.

&gt;I an amenable to becoming a dad, but not yet. I just turned 30, I'm really not ready for that.

Again, you need to communicate that.  Children are a huge area of negotiation and compromise in healthy marriages.  If, when, and how many needs to be discussed repeatedly.  The two of you need to work this out.  In the meantime since you don't need protection from STD's, I strongly recommend that you check out lambskin condoms.  It's a huge difference from regular condoms.  

By the way, it is extremely reasonable for her to go off hormonal birth control well before she intends to get pregnant.  Sometimes it takes quite awhile for a woman's body to get back on a normal cycle, especially after years of artificial hormones.  IUD's come with their own problems, like very heavy periods and awful cramps for lots of women.  You are married.  It's a reasonable expectation that sometimes you will have the burden of birth control.  Don't just say, ""I don't like condoms"".

Yes, there is. It's the one that includes Star Wars, Bladerunner, 2001, Alien, Moon, Deus Ex, and many, many others; the one that most normal people go by, and so the most (if not the only) useful definition. The only thing I see in common between all of these is a certain aesthetic.

We are discussing this because you or I or Dick is wrong. Our definitions conflict, but one is probably true. The definition is up for discussion until we find an answer. Wouldn't you agree?

I've proposed an answer. You've called it dumb.

"&gt;Please do start actually advocating against the shitty things Milo and other have received and not just using them for a ""but but but"" against other people receiving threats.

Other than condemning them, what else do you think I should be doing? And I'm not using them to dismiss other threats, I don't need to do that: Most, if not all, of the other threats fall into the aforementioned category of ""irrelevant internet rants"" or ""irrelevant third party trolling."" Neither of which are a credible threat.

&gt;Fuck you she was showing an overly-aggressive response to the idea of a woman criticizing video games from a feminist perspective. She was showing there's real fucking shitty attitudes towards women and feminists speaking out on the internet.

Right. That's all they were complaining about. Naturally Kite Tales et al have received similar floods of trolls, oh wait! No, she's an actual gamer who knows her subject. But I'm glad you're willing to admit that people are actually complaining about nonsense youtube comments.

&gt;How much people donated her to spite that response is beyond her control.

Funny, and there was I thinking responsible business people set a limit on the amount of capital they'd accept.

&gt;I'm gonna admit fault here. No way to tell if they can or cannot follow the threat was meant for the threats that have home addresses and graphic descriptions of violence against the threatened, not stupid youtube comments

I'll agree that's reasonable, at least in that there's a slim chance they might be serious. Personally I wouldn't give them a moments thought until IRL stuff started happening though.

&gt;I agree that they should not be taken seriously as a threat, but should be considered extremely fucking dickish when sent to people receiving the threats people give a shit about and should be seen as a definite problem with online discourse.

"If he were a competition shooter that'd be one thing.  But you seem to have missed the part about ""cleaned out his basement and found...""  That's akin to hoarder behavior, where you say, ""Oh, I like this for [justification], it would certainly come in handy for [unlikely situation].""  And that's what seems to have happened.  But being the rational guy that he is, he off-loaded a bunch of them - because he's an enthusiast, not a competitor.  Like if I have running shoes, sprint shoes, football cleats, baseball spikes, etc., but I only watch most of those sports, but maybe I only go out to shoot hoops with my friends occasionally.  Why the fuck do I have all those shoes if they're just cluttering up my basement, waiting for the day that will never come?  Anyway my dad got a 9mm carbine out of the situation that he'll probably never use (I think a CX4 Storm?  Idk it's been a while and I only got to see it once), but it's a nice gun to have in case... a bunch of bad guys decide to raid the farm and trap you in the barn I guess?

So it was a rhetorical question that a bunch of people with no bearing on the situation feel the need to chime in on.  When my dad told me we both chuckled at the amount... because we both know, and the point is, he doesn't need all those guns, as he figured out himself.

"Oh, I'm sure she loves being able to go around and whine, ""Both of my daughters ABANDONED me!""

That said, I'm actually very glad to see a father who, for once, doesn't just toss his kids aside, tell them that they need to 'forgive' and 'understand' while the narcissist does nothing to change, or otherwise just completely defend the NMother at all cost. 

That said, the odds of success with therapy anyway are very small, and even smaller now that she's refused to go. She's not the problem, after all, you are -- at least in her mind. I've known some other narcissists who agreed to go to therapy, but they simply wanted to go in the hopes an outside party would gang up on the other person. When the therapist, instead, called out the narcissist, it all went to shit with explosive tantrums before they walked out and refused to ever go back.

Whereas 1 kg og water at 20 degrees needs 2593kJ so the ice only takes 16% more energy than the water, which doesn't really make a difference. On a side note I was surprised at how much of the energy goes into vaporising the water compared to warming it from 20 degrees to boiling point, 87% of the energy needed to get water vapor from 20 degree water is used after it hits 99 degrees.

"The most reliable way to prevent that kind of construction error is to use a pair of smaller docking ports instead of a single port for each connection.  It does have the drawback of increasing your part count (twice as many docking ports total), however, DPAI gets you close enough that the game will correct it the rest of the way when the pair of ports lock together.

The reason this works is that the ""magnetic force"" of the two docking-port pairs normally pulls the newest part into the correct alignment if you don't close the distance too quickly. If one of the pair doesn't align properly or doesn't lock in place, undock, move a few meters away then redock and it normally corrects the matter.",false,false,t1_cmbelkw,krenshala,,0,1416812099,t5_2wrxb,t3_2n7wnx,t3_2n7wnx,4,1425869421,0,0,cmbelkw,KerbalAcademy,4,,,

"Canon EF-S 15-85 IS USM vs. Canon EF-S 24-105 f/4L IS USM -- or buy a new body?

I've currently got a Canon EF-S 15-85 IS USM that I use on my T1i.  I'm now thinking of my next purchase, and deciding if I should go with the 24-105 lens (I'd still like a walk-around, but a bit of extra zoom would be nice), or go for a newer body (T5i/70D).  

A third option would be for a non-Canon (i.e., Sigma) lens.  

So the real question is -- is there a marked difference in the quality of pics and range of pics I can get with my current 15-85 lens vs. that I'd get with the 24-105?  Most of my pics are either city/nature shots or indoors with people (I've got a new niece, so lots of pics of her/family).

"Since I don't have any info about your pc specs or when exactly it happens, I'm just throw in some general tips.

**First thing you are going to do is clean up and reset every setting in your game.** 

Before you do it, let's do a backup of two files - **config.cfg** and **video.txt.** Also, keep your binds in **autoexec.cfg**.

To do it, go to your CSGO directory (STEAMDIR\steamapps\common\Counter-Strike Global Offensive\csgo\cfg).

Backup these files or delete them completly:

If you're low on space you can also clean your /cache/ folder - you can find there not-completed downloads of maps or sounds from community servers. 

You've now reseted the whole game to the default state - also the lowest graphical options possible. As the settings goes - you can configure it whatever you want, but if you want more fps i'll advise keeping low graphic settings. Well, you can change resolution (or you like playing on 640x480.)

**Set up your launch options like this (You can find it under ""Properties"" on your list. Just right click on Counter-Strike: Global Offensive.):**

*-novid -nod3d9ex -threads x (x is numer of your cores) -high*


**novid** - it disables the intro, pretty useful

**nod3d9ex** - disables some external effects of DirectX - give you more FPS

**threads x** - threads of your processor (if you dont know it, use core number)

"La fundación CEPS, dirigida por Iglesias y varios líderes hoy de Podemos, guió en 2011 la guerra sucia propagandística de Hugo Chávez contra los opositores venezolanos. Aconsejó al Ejecutivo bolivariano infiltrar policías y médicos entre los opositores venezolanos para erosionar su credibilidad e intentar reputarles de locos.  
En septiembre de 2011 la fundación CEPS (Centro de Estudios Políticos y Sociales), vivero político y económico de los dirigentes de Podemos, aconsejó al Gobierno de Hugo Chávez infiltrar topos policiales y médicos entre la veintena de opositores venezolanos en huelga de hambre con el fin de obtener datos para desacreditarlos (“erosión de la verosimilitud del hecho”) y, de paso, tacharlos de locos (“identificar posibles incapacidades mentales del huelguista”). Pablo Iglesias, secretario general de Podemos, ha sido miembro del patronato de la fundación CEPS desde 2008 a 2014. Esta entidad que se autodefine ‘sin ánimo de lucro’ ha tenido desde 2003 al Gobierno venezolano como su principal y casi único cliente, lo que le reportó más de 3,7 millones de euros.
Pero lo más llamativo no es que la fundación embrión de Podemos (entre sus dirigentes también figuran Íñigo Errejón, su polémico empleador, Alberto Montero, y tenía como asiduo colaborador a Juan Carlos Monedero) asesorara al Gobierno de Hugo Chávez como una mera consultoría política privada, pero pagando muchos menos impuestos que una sociedad mercantil de las que prestan similares servicios a los partidos en España, sino el calado de los consejos que le dio.
Vozpópuli ha tenido acceso a los informes de asesoría que le valieron tan generosos pagos, hasta un millón anual. Y la sorpresa es que una parte significativa de ellos sirvieron para guiar los pasos del Gobierno de Chávez para neutralizar a la oposición venezolana, en ocasiones con técnicas de guerra sucia dignas de la peor dictadura. Por ejemplo, el 15 de septiembre de 2011 los asesores de CEPS del régimen bolivariano emiten un informe táctico tituladoInsumos ante las tácticas desestabilizadoras de la oposición.
El informe de la fundación que ya dirigían los futuros líderes de Podemos aclaraba cuál era la revuelta que intentaba acallar su cliente, el Gobierno venezolano: “Analizamos dos de las posibles técnicas desestabilizadoras opositoras, vinculadas ambas con el intento de apropiación de la bandera de la defensa de los derechos humanos: concretamente la huelga de hambre y la instrumentalización de asociaciones relacionadas con la violencia, así como trataremos posibles respuestas institucionales”. ¿Y cuál fue el consejo dado por esta fundación que declaraba como su fin “el fomento de la democracia participativa y las garantías efectivas de protección de los derechos humanos”?
Véase literamente el escalonamiento de sus consejos a Chávez:
“El 7 de septiembre pasado, el observatorio venezolano de conflictividad social informaba del repunte a 18 de las huelgas de hambre que por unos u otros motivos tienen lugar en el país. Frente a otros métodos de lucha social que requieren la movilización de un grupo importante de afectados, este método social se caracteriza por su alta visibilidad y factibilidad para grupos pequeños e incluso individuales de demandantes. No obstante lo dicho, el alto número de iniciativas de este tipo en el país diluyen el peso de las mismas, por lo que sus participantes se ven obligados a radicalizar sus acciones (como fue el caso de los estudiantes que cosieron parcialmente sus bocas)”.
Pero el peligro mediático de tal revuelta opositora era evidente para el equipo español de CEPS al servicio de Chávez. “La huelga de hambre cobra especial repercusión mediática cuando el o la huelguista ve deteriorado su físico e incluso llega a morir debido a los fallos multiorgánicos producto de la inanición. Este fue el caso de la criminalización al estado venezolano con motivo del fallecimiento de Franklin Brito hace ahora un año. Y es que en el caso venezolano este tipo de eventos se vincula indefectiblemente por la mediocracia opositora nacional e internacional a una supuesta violación de derechos humanos en Venezuela. Efectivamente, una búsqueda por referencia cruzada de los términos “derechos humanos” y “huelga de hambre” en Venezuela entre las noticias del primer semestre de 2011 arroja 533 eventos que generaron a su vez en torno a las 100 inserciones en prensa cada uno, es decir, más de 50.000 impactos mediáticos, con la repercusión que esto conlleva a la imagen pública, especialmente internacional, del Proceso [bolivariano]”.
Y, naturalmente, para la fundación de los hoy dirigentes de Podemos la prensa internacional era injusta con Chávez por entender que no violaba más los derechos humanos que la democracia española. “Evidentemente existe un vulgarísimo doble rasero entre los latifundios mediáticos nacionales e internacionales, ya que basta sustitituir Venezuela por España en la búsqueda y aparecen unas escasas 76 apariciones para el primer semestre, siendo éstas, además, mayoritariamente referencias a acusaciones de instituciones españolas por las violaciones de derechos humanos en Cuba”.
Las recetas de CEPS para huelguistas de hambre
A la hora de plantear recetas a Chávez contra los opositores venezolanos en huelga de hambre, CEPS pierde todo pudor y plantea medidas nunca implantadas en la España democrática. Véase su literalidad:
“Frente a nuevas huelgas de hambre de sectores opositores se apuntan algunas posibles respuestas a evaluar:
-Erosión de la verosimilitud de la medida de hecho: en la mayoría de los casos, la medida de hecho no es tal, simplemente una impostura. Sería conveniente seguir desvelando esta situación siempre que sea posible, desplazando e infiltrando entre los huelguistas a miembros de los cuerpos y fuerzas de seguridad del Estado.
-Erosión de las reivindicaciones de los huelguistas: por injustas, mediante la difusión por vocerías interpuestas (organizaciones sociales, medios de comunicación) de las contradicciones en los reclamos; por faltas de fundamento, detallando y desglosando en el seguimiento del debido proceso por parte de las instituciones venezolanas en los casos cuestionados; por ilegítimas, evidenciando el irrespeto a las normas morales y jurídicas por parte de los protestantes o sus defendidos, como en el caso de los políticos presos; por imposibles, sosteniendo la bandera de la independencia de poderes, la fortaleza de la institucionalidad y la iniquidad de la apelación a instancias superiores cuando en Venezuela se respeta el estado de derecho y sus procesos señalando al tiempo a los demandantes los mecanismos formales existentes para vehicular sus protestas”.
Pero aunque CEPS pregona que Venezuela es un Estado de Derecho que no merece tales huelguistas brinda a Chávez unas fórmulas nada democráticas para aplastarlos: “Podría ser especialmente útil enviar servicios médicos que demuestren la disposición del Gobierno a evitar la degeneración de la salud de los huelguistas y que expliquen a estos las gravísimas consecuencias físicas de una huelga de hambre, así como la posibilidad de éstos de minimizar sus riesgos a la salud en el caso de que permitan la ingesta de fluidos. Los médicos establecerían además un canal de comunicación y confianza muy útil para la negociación con el huelguista, para lo cuál debe mantener desde el principio su imagen de asesor médico independiente evitando tratar de convencer de forma directa de deponer su actitud”.
Infiltrar estos médicos entre los opositores en lucha tendría otra utilidad aún más perversa para el Gobierno de Chávez: “identificando en las primerísimas etapas del conflicto posibles incapacidades mentales del huelguista en caso de que las hubiera y pudieran ser causales de la radicalización de la misma. Para ello será preciso contar con un objetivo historial médico del sujeto, así como información de proximidad de sus parientes, vecinos, respecto a su comportamiento pasado”. Incluso el secreto médico sería un arma contra los huelguistas, ya que serviría para “reducir la visibilidad de la huelga; en este caso, el argumento central es la información médica que el Estado está obligado a dar al huelguista”.
Este diario ha reclamado, sin éxito, por teléfono e email la valoración de Iglesias, Errejón y Monedero para que opinen si juzgan acordes a la Declaración Universal de Derechos Humanos tales prácticas y si las aplicarían en España, caso de llegar al Gobierno, para neutralizar conflictos similares.

"How do I know life is a test? Because Allah has showed this to me. Every time I have lied it has bitten me in the back, everything I have stolen has broken, when I behave with envy It only leads to insecurity and jealous emotions which lead to negativity in my relationships, when I don't fast I don't get rewarded. When I read about pork being one of the only meats that contains parasites that cooking cannot kill. When I see that fasting improved ones immune system and cleanses the system, Allah knows best. Mainly what tells me that it's a test is the fact that I have learned all these things and I see that the better I behave the more I am rewarded I do not bother to sin anymore, I am rewarded on this earth immediately, my life has changed so much due to islam for the better, I mean financial spiritual material relationship rewards.

yea rip sinclar :( unless he had become like robot and his machine self was fully drone and he's been projecting his consciousness from somewhere else secret.  find this unlikely as he was represented as mostly cyborg, not fully drone.  

i was unsatisfied by the stalemate but wasn't looking forward to the genocide of the viltrumites either if mark/nolan had won (them and oliver would be the last viltriumites, with nolan the only full-blooded, and that's assuming all three of them even survived).  i think the truce makes sense and i was looking forward to humanity changing them, and now that nolan is in charge that will probably happen even faster.  

although, in this robot arc, i don't see how nolan and eve both survive if kirkman's intentions are to reboot everything.  i really hope they don't both die, but i see one of them as having to go for maximum emotional impact on mark.  for his sake, i hope it's nolan that dies.  if eve dies, mark is done for morally.",false,true,t1_cioinv0,nostempore,,0,1404494122,t5_2srew,t3_292bm8,t1_cin0lby,1,1434550548,0,0,cioinv0,Invincible,1,,,

"PE is technically defined as a man orgasming sooner than he wants. There is no actual time limit for it. If you both enjoy 3-5 minutes of PIV then it is not PE. What worked for us (and his PE was only occasional) was me telling him that I'd done some reading on it and that PE is almost never a physical problem. It's almost always caused by stress and anxiety. And he already knew that anxiety over PE was going to cause it to happen more often. I also taught him about edging. I told him it's something he can do at home alone while masturbating and something we could do together during sex. He already knew I was patient and understanding. There has not been an episode of PE since. In fact I've been surprised at how long he lasts sometimes. There are so many factors that can cause PE. Some men experience it more often in missionary. Sometimes eye contact with this woman he thinks is so sexy can cause it. If you work on it together and discover his triggers you can probably just about eliminate the issue.

"There's a theory going around that it wasn't Grey Wolves, but rather a currently extinct sub-species of Grey Wolf that humans first domesticated. The theory posits that the wolves fit into the ecological niche of scavenger. These scavenger-wolves followed around nomadic hunter-gatherers, subsisting off their droppings and garbage. This is beneficial because dogs often redeposit the waste outside of the human settlement.

A little known, and totally gross, secret that many dog owners learn while camping - [many dogs eat human feces](http://www.aspca.org/pet-care/virtual-pet-behaviorist/dog-behavior/coprophagia-eating-feces) (and love it). They also engage in other behaviors that would benefit hunter-gatherer societies, such as [wound-licking](http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/canine-corner/201106/can-dogs-help-humans-heal), functioning as guards and more.

"I'm sorry to hear you have such problems! That sucks.

That said, it kind of sounds like you are catastrophizing right now. Which, just for the record, is completely understandable and ok. However, it does mean that you are possibly not looking at the situation fully rationally. This isn't meant to criticize - only to encourage you to take a deep breath, take a step back, and realize that while it might feel like everything around sex is horrible right now, that doesn't mean it actually is. (just for the record, I have a distinct tendency to catastrophize when I get upset. it's a thing.)

Just how recent is this diagnosis? A dianosis is not the end of the world, and having a word for what is going on does not suddenly box you in. On the contrary, it can be really helpful! Now that you have a name for what is happening, you can educate yourself and hopefully learn ways to deal with it.

I assume that you are already talking to your doctor about options and ways to deal with it (and if you're not, do so!). Whenever you feel ready, definitely start doing your own research, look for possible communities online, see what people have to say. 

Finally, you are not selfish for taking care of yourself or not wanting to have sex when it is incredibly painful. That is simply taking care of yourself. If your bf really cares about you, he'll stick with you. He's not ""stuck"" with you, he is choosing to be with you. His choice. Respect that, and appreciate it.

"&gt;That's so vague it's useless.

It's an observational fact. You seem confused about the ability and *a particular theory of what makes up that*. That gravity exists is an observational fact - Einsteinian space-time is a *theory* of gravity. Evolution is a fact (that evolution happens) and a theory (the theory of how evolution actually takes place). UG is just the same - it's a fact that humans have the ability to acquire language, and then there's a theory *about what that ability is*.

That you don't understand the terminology should suggest to you that you shouldn't comment on things you don't understand.

&gt;What do you mean by that?

Artificial languages that use linear rules - ones that rely purely on linear order - aren't acquirable in the same way as human languages, and are [processed differently in the brain](http://www.nature.com/neuro/journal/v6/n7/full/nn1077.html).

"&gt; Entrepenurs: We know that Entrepenurs are the life blood of Capitalism. Without low entry barriers you cannot have competition, and without competition you cannot have efficiency. Therefore, any system that encourages and makes easier Entrepenurs is a successful one.

Everyone always forgets how conflicted capitalism truly is on the issue of competition.  On paper every capitalist touts the virtue of competition, but in practice every businessman abhors competition, views it as a destructive force, and tries to kill it by **ANY** means necessary, legal and illegal and everything in between (gray areas).

Capitalism is much more about the accumulation and control of capital than it is about competition.  Competition requires equal access to capital.  And capitalism detests the notion of equal access to capital.

So I think while the capitalist ideology often pays lip service to competition, in practice the actual participating living and breathing capitalists see competition as a dark and evil force that is to be avoided at all costs.

The 290 runs everything MUCH better obviously, but it isn't ""impossible"" to play at 4k on a less robust card as you might believe (Cause I definitely did).

&gt;I am a bit concerned about sinking all of my assets into a house. Additionally I am unsure if I want to continue the working life, I may want to take a break 2 years from now and take some time off to look at changing careers or starting a business or something. So I may want to sell a house I purchase 2 years from now.

You have your answer. You should not be buying a house. 

Financially, $25k in the bank on a $85k salary isn't enough for the Bay Area. You need 3-6 months of an emergency fund saved up. Take that from your $25k and you have next to nothing for a down payment. And I don't know if you're being deliberately vague about what your parents want to help with or if you don't know yourself. Do your parents know the Bay Area market well? Homes can cost easily $750k. They would need to shell out $150k for a 20% down payment. Your mortgage would be very high as well. Not to mention, you'd have pay for utilities, HOA, closing costs, property tax on a $750k house, maintenance, etc. 

In addition, your parents logic is flawed. 

&gt;-the bay area traditionally sees house prices increase

The average return on a home is 0%. It's not an investment. When people buy their houses for $250k and sell it 10 years later for $300k, they see it as a $50k profit. It isn't. Add in the hidden costs of owning/buying a home mentioned above plus the cost of inflation and you don't make anything. Now when you sell it you do get some of it back, but that isn't always enough to cover all the interest and other costs you paid. Prices will typically rise, and the longer you stay in no house the better of a deal you'll get. But if you have to move early you take a financial loss. What if we are in another housing bubble? You could be underwater. 

&gt;-the money I'm paying for rent would go towards a mortgage

Yes, but rent money is not wasted money. Renting is less riskier than home ownership as mentioned above. Rent money is just like paying for any other service. You get something for something. Renting is cheaper, and the money you save can be better invested into retirement or other investments.

&gt;-taxes would go towards the mortgage

I'm not sure what you mean by this. 

It seems like your parents are using out of date, populist reasons for buying a home. The housing market crash proved that your primary residence is not an investment, that housing prices don't inevitably go up, and that buying a house is much riskier than renting. 

In sum, you don't make enough, don't have enough saved up, and your parents logic is out of date. I would definitely not buy a house if I were you.

"One idea I had a while ago. A mega-meta event, spanning a whole zone, multiple zones or the entire world.

Maybe it's fighting a dragon not by chipping away it's health bar ourselves, but by participating in event spread over a very wide area, for example defending huge AA cannons while they power up to fire. Coordination for events done simultaneously has been shown as problematic though, so I'd suggest having a reasonably relaxed timescale on it and just have a goal of X completed sub-meta-events within an hour. I get the idea anet is stepping in this direction a little.

The other possibility is a global 'enemy presence' bar, that goes up or down depending on player completion of events. So if players aren't doing much, enemies get stronger and events vary a bit to account for that, and they get more lucrative similar to the bonus xp you'll already get on mobs that have a long time since they spawned.

"The exact quote is _By making these improvements, the phpng branch gives us a considerable performance gain in real world applications, for example a 20% increase in throughput for Wordpress._

I'm going to assume English isn't your native language based upon your misunderstand of the article and your mispelling of the past tense form of say (it's said, not sayed, although I can understand why that's confusing for non-native speakers).

It references performance many times in the article, including the sentence I just quoted.  In addition, it talks a lot about JIT, and that being the eventual goal.  This puts the context as CPU time, and what it meant by the phrase ""throughput for Wordpress"" is that Wordpress had specifically been tested and shown to be able to serve 20% more traffic than before (due to the increase in CPU performance).

"Hey man, I wish you the best luck with your journey to sobriety. I understand you're going through some tough shit, but honestly that's what life is about. How well you do dealing with the many curve balls life throws at you. My suggestion would be keep up the no drinking that right there is a great accomplishment and something to be proud of! As for the trees I'd say slow down a lot from what you have been doing. For instance if you're smoking routine consists of smoking everytime you're bored or to pass time then find something else to do instead of smoking to past that time. Once you make it through your day and get done what you need to get done, then and only then you should reward yourself with a joint or bowl or whatever smoking method you choose. It's not easy sticking to a plan like that at first but it gets soooo much easier and you feel so much more fresh minded. Then as you stick to that for a few weeks cut back and make it every other day and so on until you're finally can function without the feeling of wanting to get high.

"&gt; Humans are universally selfish.

No. That's capitalist PR, not truth. You might not find this in Ayn Rand's books, but it turns out that humans are incredibly complex creatures, and while selfishness and greed are parts of our nature, so are altruism and love.

Talk to some artists. See what they tell you. I'm sure a few are in it for the bucks (now that's a funny thought - anyone choosing the field of art to make a profit didn't choose very intelligently), but many do it because they want to give something to society. There's also ""social rewards"", the inherent joy in creating something new, and just putting food on the table, too. Again, we're complex.

But I can call corporate middlemen parasites because that's exactly what they are. They impede the essential remixing and copying that keeps art fresh. They take monopoly rents and charge outrageous prices for ""products"" that cost practically nothing (how much does an album's worth of bandwidth cost?).

"Days like these are completely normal for us type 1's. I avoid sometimes discussing my blood sugar with those who aren't experts or diabetic themselves. Every diabetic (type 1 and type 2) are all different. We each react differently to certain types of carbs. For instance if I don't have any carbs in the morning, I get highs throughout the day. Also my sugars seem to do better with pasta rather than pizza dough, which seems weird since they're both complex carbs. Experiment with the types of carbs you're eating and always eat at least 1 carb each meal and snack. They help stabilize your sugars. I would write down your sugars and a weeks worth of food diaries and show your endo and nutritionist and see what they recommend doing.

Your computer creates an encrypted tunnel to the proxy, and then accesses the internet through regular protocols, like http, from there.

Proxies themselves can absolutely be banned.  They can be IP blacklisted or put on an unroutable routing list.

"I started with Oblivion. But the empire in Oblivion and Morrowind is decidedly *not* the same empire as in Skyrim. Same name, same capital. All else is different - the rulers, the laws, and even the territory held. This is pretty clear by the fact that even the Blades you meet in game hold no particular interest in the war - if it was truly *their* empire they'd be doing their best to convince the Dragonborn to fight on the imperial side. Instead they barely mention it. 

It'd be like comparing the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth to Soviet-era Poland. 

Basically, the empire is not the grand, noble, well-intentioned ally it was in previous games. It is crumbling, powerless, and corrupt. Its followers are still noble... but that's true of any enemy. There are even noble Thalmor. Or noble Greeks for that matter :P It's broke, unable to defend itself, and on its last legs. Someone pointed out in a previous thread that Skyrim is the only province still held by the empire at the time of the game. Especially when you look at Hammerfell's success during the Great War, it's pretty clear that rebellion is without a doubt the best option. It sucks for Cyrodiil, sure. But an independent Skyrim, without Cyrodiil's debts and laws, might actually be able to help Cyrodiil in a war against the Thalmor better than they could as a vassal state. 

Edit: removed the other real life references because I like the Poland one the best. It's perfect. A Major Power went from one of the most feared empires on the continent (no really) to the tiny, powerless puppet of an outside, evil state (ok Soviet Russia isn't totally evil, but then neither are the Thalmor) due to a series of bad wars and outside influences, and giving its vassals too much power. And it happened over about the same span of time as the Cyrodiil empire (400 years), without changing capitals or general government type (much).

I say 'revolting' because it signals a willingness to abandon principles of equality, etc, in the face of difficulties.  If you value the principles of the system then your experience is an argument for reform, not a two-tiered system.  And if you think that a two-tiered system is consistent with the current principles I invite you to think very carefully about what sorts of socio-economic incentives and effects such a system would have on the broader society.

My logic was: If we are together and we both are still very much in love, what happens if we get great jobs in different far away places? Either one would have to sacrifice something very valuable or a breakup would happen at that point. I figured that I was young and the sooner I made the motions, the easier it would be in the long run. It was awful. We both sobbed. I felt so guilty, but deep down I knew it was right and ultimately so did she. I don't regret the decision at all. We both got great jobs, far apart.  Although there was a period of no talking, we eventually became friends again (we were friends before we dated).

"So because Christianity went through reformation, islam can't go through one, or should ""hurry up""? I'd argue that most muslims are indeed fighting that questioning everyday, in an effort to learn the correct way. The Quran is more self interpretation, which is where you have this breed of extremists. The Quran also says: ""We ordained for the Children of Israel that if anyone slew a person - unless it be in retaliation for murder or for spreading mischief in the land - it would be as if he slew all mankind: and if anyone saved a life, it would be as if he saved the life of all humanity."" It's funny by changing christianity from the old testament, to the new testament, they somehow are immune from the fact that their god is blood thirsty turned loving parent.

Like you said, both theocracies are bad, I'm just not sure I want to live in a world where WBC were running government.

"oh VG why did you crash so hard against the better teams yesterday



* (BO3) HGT vs **[LV Gaming]** - HGT had a change of mid players to Air, who was the person that impressed me the most during the pre-TI4 season in DT.NGC (now disbanded) with his brew plays. BUT with the addition of new players, they might need to work on their synergy. sure, it'll be hard to play against 2 very talented core players, but LV Gaming's players aren't bad themselves. they managed to win CDEC 2-0 in D2L and DK 2-1 (although DK seems to be in a rut right now). **it's quite risky, but i'll bet on the underdogs here**

* (BO3) **[iG]** vs LGD - i felt that their BO1 yesterday was actually close and could have went either way, but maybe the tiny deny-pick for Luo wasn't that good. as i've said, between the chinese teams, it's all about that draft (all about that draft, no treble~). iG upset many yesterday by winning VG with that aggressive draft (combined with a fy god kotl.. whyyyy) and i think if they drafts well, they can take 2 games off LGD. **if my arcana survives LV gaming, i'll bet on iG**

* (BO2) DK vs **[VG]** - despite losing 2 games yesterday, i just don't see VG dropping 2 games in a row to DK. **not gonna bother though, 90/10 is seriously shit odds**

* (BO2) LGD vs VG - LGD needs to play perfect games to win both matches, whereas i think VG needs a good draft (and no more fy kotl). if VG wants to win SyL, they need as many wins as they can get. **at 30/70, i can still consider betting on VG, but once VG wins DK, the odds are bound to shift**

* (BO1) LaiG vs **[CDEC]** - i feel that LaiG isn't really that impressive, whereas CDEC is playing well. seems like a good bet on CDEC

* (BO1) **[CDEC]** vs DK - DK needs to get out of their rut like.. real soon or i think disbanderino is imminent. CDEC shouldn't really drop this if they want to contend for top 4, which is now possible since VG dropped 2 games already

* (BO1) VG vs LGD - VG can only afford to drop 1 more game before they aren't secured a spot for TS2, and i think CDEC and LGD are potentially the ones to beat them. you might wanna watch the BO2 SyL game though

* (BO1) DK vs VG - if VG loses the BO1 to LGD, they'll really need the rest of the wins to get to the top 4

* (BO1) **[TS]** vs Alliance - TS is dominant against everyone except VG so far. odds, however, seems a bit risky to go big

* (BO1) **[TS]** vs Fnatic - TS should win. shit odds tho",false,false,t1_cle3sub,WhitePepsi24,,0,1413759401,t5_2xomz,t3_2jq276,t3_2jq276,3,1426448055,0,0,cle3sub,dota2loungebets,3,,028,

"I mostly agree with you, but for one exception: this is true specifically for *economically* rational actors.  But humans are neither economical nor rational (obviously) and sometimes this even works to our advantage.  Think, for instance, of someone unwilling to take a job as a chef for $10 an hour, but willing to spend 6 hours cooking Thanksgiving dinner for their family.  If we were only talking economical rationality, that would be a $60 mistake.  But in the greater sense of rationality, you'd be hard-pressed to find a psychologist who would recommend spending thanksgiving cooking for a low wage instead of with your family.

Some systems (both social and economic) are better at exploiting this alternate side of humanity and rationality than others.

Unfortunately, this goes both ways too - companies have mission statements to exploit your desire to work with a group to achieve your goals.  But at the end of the day, it's a financial transaction to them.  You regularly see companies trying to get their employees to treat them like ""family"" - but you won't see them helping you move, lending you money when the chips are down, or any of the other things families might do for each other.  But most people will work hard for their families without *any* compensation.  And most obviously, direct propaganda to voters to convince them that their position, however idiotic, is somehow ""good for society"" (prohibiting gay marriage is a good example of this.)  This sort of thing will cause people to rally more effectively and enthusiastically than actually paying them in many cases, as our social motivations are so strong.

So you create gas and sparks.

An extreme would be generating a roomful of gas in under a second, then exploding the entire room. A much less extreme would be just creating a small stream of fire.

In theory, if you could violently expel the gas in a somewhat concentrated cone, you could start the gas going, light it, and then the gas would stay lit as long as you kept expelling gas, and then if you had the beforementioned mega output of gas, you could make a roomsized flamethrower that lasts as long as you want it to.",false,false,t1_ckxv3x7,Blackstream,,0,1412200795,t5_2vhg0,t3_2hy3el,t1_ckx6yl8,3,1426730335,0,0,ckxv3x7,RWBY,3,,pyr3,

"I'm going to be the abnormal one here, but I never wanted a traditional publishing contract. My first book was conceived and drafted in my senior year of HS, and it was AWFUL. But the characters stuck with me, so I knew I had to try a new approach to the whole writing thing later. Fast forward a few years post-graduation, and I bit the bullet, published my first book, and let everything ride. 

There are a few things that made me decide to self-publish. A huge part was that I had charted Amanda Hocking's dance across the indie-sphere from the beginning, and had already learned from her mistakes. Another was the support I found online through FB- other self-published authors just hitting the market or prepping like I was. A few took me under their wings and poured support for me like no other. The last factor would have to be my insane dedication to writing, as I could never stop, and apparently I'm 'quirky' and 'adorable' online and in person, so people apparently like me? 

In the future, I'd consider a contract with a house, if only for a separate series I'd create for the market (yawn) and better shelf exposure (yay) which in turn can jump my backlist nicely. 

My breaking point was that I wanted to write, end of story, and I was going to find a way to make money off of it come hell or high water. I say don't give up. If it's truly your passion, you'll find a way. 

(BTW, we all know about the slush pile of self-pub ebooks. Thankfully the whole 'cream rises to the top' deal does apply in most cases. Every so often a crap novel pushes through because it has shock value, but it never lasts.)

The mechanisms have obvious Beretta influences.  It also has a 'triple action' mode built in.  After loading when the barrel is hot and the hammer back, you can push the hammer forward, setting a somewhere between Double and Single action.  Slight trigger pull 'snaps' the hammer directly to the SA mode much faster/lighter than a traditional double-action pull.  Here's some video reviews from the usuals.

"I've handle a Keyboard for years and have now had a Voyage for about 3 weeks.

1) It's not as good. I want my buttons back.

Now it's not horrible. I'm still using them more than the touch screen and I've gotten use to them, but they are *not* a replacement for physical buttons. You can adjust the pressure, I think I've moved it back to the 'middle' setting. Since they're not actually physical buttons they don't detect force in the same way so some things that worked great on my keyboard (such as pressing at an angle) don't work as well. (More notes in section 2)

They PagePress sensors don't work everywhere either, which I'm finding *infuriating*. They feel tacked on. They change pages and I accidentally discovered that holding one and tapping the screen seems to be a shortcut to something odd (don't remember what) but otherwise they're not integrated *at all*.

Want to scroll to the next pages of books? Or the next page on the list of WiFi networks? Or the next page in the Kindle store on the device? The PagePress sensors don't work for any of that. You *must* swipe with your finger in a gesture. Things that I used to do all the time on my Keyboard using those buttons don't work and it's breaking my muscle memory.

I also miss having the menu and home buttons. I used the menu button on my Keyboard as a shortcut to open the menu to check the time, now that requires screen tapping.

2) It's too thin. It's actually pretty nice but I've come to the conclusion it's just too thin. I've basically never used my Keyboard without the leather cover.

I just got the leather Origami cover in the mail today. It's kind of ugly, but it snaps on very well thanks to magnets and the 'unlock the kindle when you open it' feature is very nice. From about a half hour of reader earlier it seems like the PagePress sensors are easier to use when the device is thicker, I don't have a final report.

I'd prefer more color options and I think $60 is too expensive, but none of the 3rd party cases seem anywhere near as nice.

3) The screen on the Voyage is *much nicer* than my Keyboard, but I haven't spent enough time with a Paperwhite to compare. I remember being able to see uneven backlight on the Paperwhite I played with (I'm a picky-assed person, it bugged me) but it seems perfectly even on my Voyage. 

It really does make reading easier in normal light as it increases the contrast. I don't tend to read in the dark, but when my apartment isn't very bight I don't need to turn on a lamp or the overhead light (and deal with the reflections). I keep it pretty low (9 of 24) so it's more supplemental for me, I don't have it blaring. It can get pretty bright, I assume to help in direct sun.

Hope that helps. I'm still pissed about the physical buttons and various stupid software quirks I think should have been ironed out, but I've changed my mind and decided to keep it because the screen is just *so nice*. I'm hoping software updates fix some of the oddities.

If they bring back real physical buttons next year I'll quickly replace it, but the screen is just gorgeous.",false,false,t1_cmfu6mt,mbcook,,0,1417231795,t5_2qudz,t3_2notkl,t3_2notkl,1,1425777839,0,0,cmfu6mt,kindle,1,,,

"&gt; I don't know your lecturer, but I do have lots of experience with music and academia, and let me tell you: there is very often a significant disconnect between academia and the real world. There are lots of teachers who are stuck in their ways - they started using pencil and paper, so why should these younger people have access to tools that make it so easy to write? Sibelius and Finale are relatively recent creations, so we don't yet have a generation of composers who have written mostly in software, but I'm pretty sure it's the future.

Generally, the argument I give when I have to defend pencil-and-paper composition is that you're less likely to limit yourself based on the notation you're using.  Secondarily, as /u/rbridson noted, you don't necessarily want to be chained to Sibelius/Finale as your listening device, because they aren't going to sound like the actual performance, and you may find yourself writing so that the digital rendering sounds good -- not so that the actual music sounds good.",false,false,t1_cmfu7ns,sbassoon,,0,1417231866,t5_2sjib,t3_2npoz7,t1_cmfpn5c,2,1425777826,0,0,cmfu7ns,composer,2,,,

"First of all, thanks for actually replying and engaging in discussion. This sub seems to going downhill lately in that regard.

&gt;Automation, being a product of collective labour provided by the design and manufacture of machinery, should thus be collectively owned as public utility, whether through cooperatives syndicates or other democratic ownership structures.

As I pointed out in my previous comment, the bitcoin network is collectively owned and democratically controlled by the miners which run and secure the network. Are you saying that those outside the system should be able to participate in controlling it?

&gt;Nearly all the technology which produces the efficient miners (that is, greater ""work/hr"" [even as far as multiple embedded devices], an attribute one would surely wish to optimize) reside in a capitalist economy, thus there exists an arbitrarily unfair wealth distribution which governs the maximum one may spend on this before their own health may suffer.

Of course there exists an unfair wealth distribution. Some people are more wealthy than others and can afford to purchase a greater percentage of the network hash rate. The rewards scale linearly though. A miner with 10% of the network hash rate will make 10x more money than a miner with 1% of the network hash rate. How is that any different than a factory worker who works 10 hours getting paid 10x more than a factory work who works 1 hour doing the same type of work? It is no different at all. It is the exact same concept.

And of course all the technology exists in a capitalist economy, that's the only economy on this planet. Also, the reason capitalism needs to come before socialism is to create all the technological infrastructure in the first place. So, I'm not sure what you are trying to get at. We've seen what happens when people try and implement socialism in a society that doesn't have the necessary material conditions to support such a society. It's always lead to authoritarian control in the past because it requires forcing workers to create the means of production in an accelerated time frame. That just leads to harsh, abysmal, slave-like work conditions and economic sanctions from the capitalists.

I'm not denying that the bitcoin ecosystem isn't socialist though. That would be absurd. Just as absurd as it would be do deny the socialist principle that bitcoin mining is based on.

&gt;What kind of social control, what democratic-ownership is this? 

It's called distributed consensus and it can be used for far more than bitcoin. The blockchain technology is going to have major impacts going forward. There already various implementations for voting, instant messaging, distributed DNS system, etc. Look up ""distributed autonomous corporations"".

&gt;The ""pay to play"" analogy you suggest is not similar, because one cannot so simply invest in the required depts necessary to create the ""better workers"" of Bitcoin.

There's nothing to stop anyone from investing in ASICminer if they have the necessary capital. The last share (AM1) sold on [Havelock](https://www.havelockinvestments.com/login.php) was for 0.24 BTC and the last 100th share (AM100) was sold for 0.0029 BTC. At an exchange rate of [589 USD/BTC](http://bitcoinity.org/markets), that's 141.36 USD and 1.71 USD respectively.

As a socialist, you don't need to invest in these capitalist corporations though. You can just buy a miner and run it. You may or may not make a profit from it, but you're not exploiting anyone by running your miner anymore than you are by having this discussion.

What you're failing to understand is that socialism isn't about wealth inequality, it's about exploitation of workers. Bitcoin mining doesn't exploit workers because the workers are machines. There's nothing anti-socialist about mining and there's no reason for socialists to be anti-bitcoin, so that just leave hatred of AnCaps, jealousy of the early adopters or technical ignorance.",false,true,t1_cjddyal,MarcusOrlyius,,0,1406841658,t5_2qjii,t3_2c6yec,t1_cjd9zlv,0,1434998055,0,0,cjddyal,socialism,0,,,

"&gt;my boyfriend watched porn and it completely is tearing me apart. I feel so un wanted, ugly, worthless, and just some piece of trash that hes just using for sex than is going to throw me away

A lot of women are insecure about their boyfriends watching porn. They don't understand that most times, it's not about them or him. Masturbation is a different urge than the urge to have sex and both serve different needs. If he's masturbating to porn to the point where it's affecting his day to day life or more importantly, his ability to desire you and have sex with you, then it's a problem. On the other hand, if masturbating to porn is just something he does in between sex or when you're not around each other for a few days and you both have a satisfying sex life then it's as normal as breathing.

You may think that he is seeking something in the women in porn that you don't have such as being more attractive, skinnier, bustier, etc. It has nothing to do with attraction. It's simply visual stimuli to make masturbation less of a ""just fulfilling the urge"" thing and more of a pleasurable experience.

&gt;I dont understand how you can claim to love someone and yet want other women? I dont understand how you could want to marry someone and then fantasize about other people?

Again, if he's avoiding sex and/or intimacy with you, then you have something to worry about but otherwise, he doesn't want those women in porn any more than he wants the girl he's checking out when you're not around. Guys look at other women because it's a normal thing to do even if you already have a girlfriend or wife. There's a difference in finding someone attractive and being attracted to them. With porn, you're not attracted to the people in them. You just use the sexual imagery to help you get off. It's not wrong to fantasize about other people. When you fantasize about Ryan Gossling in whatever romantic movie he happens to be in, you don't want him or are attracted to him are you? You just enjoy the emotional stimulation you get from these romantic fantasies the same way a guy enjoys the sexual stimulation he gets from porn based fantasies.

&gt;im so tired of everyone bull shit excuses that men are different than women its fucking bull shit.its just an excuse for guys to get away with whatever they want.

There's actually scientific evidence to show that men and women's brains are different. Whether you want to believe it or not, men and women ARE different and not just in the plumbing area. [This article](http://science.howstuffworks.com/life/men-women-different-brains.htm) explains it in better detail. 

&gt;I want to not feel so ugly 

Maybe someone has already told you this but you are the only person who can make you feel ugly. If you feel ugly, you can't blame someone else. You can't change how other people behave, but you can change your reaction to them. Your worth as a human being is not based on anything that someone else does or says...it's all about how you view yourself and how much self-esteem you have. Nothing we say is going to change how you feel about yourself. You have to accept the fact that you're not perfect and neither is he. Masturbation is normal and healthy...so is porn if it's in moderation and doesn't interfere with his day to day life.

"there are not very many animals that eat whole eggs in climates such as those in the image. 

By my bizarre logic, first fix the shit that really matters before you whine and complain about one human being hitting one golf ball into the middle of fucking nowhere. 

I can't see how you don't realize how you're sitting in an environment full of shit that is hundreds and hundreds of times worse than one guy hitting a golf ball off the top of a mountain. You know, probably in a wooden house, on a computer on a wooden desk, I mean, the list would be long of things you are doing right now which have had a much more severe negative impact on the environment as compared to one guy hitting one golf ball off of a mountain. 

It's like you're sitting there eating from a meat buffet of 1000 buffalo, and you see someone kill a squirrel and you're all up in arms. It makes no sense. 

One animal can die from eating a golf ball, and that would not be terribly likely in that place. 

Your habits make animals go extinct every day. I'm not saying don't do anything at all. I'm saying do the opposite. 

You're so fucking blind. You're destroying the world on a much grander scale, and you're doing nothing. You think one guy is stupid for hitting a golf ball off a cliff, well, news flash, you're much fucking worse than that. So, before you go condemning someone for an action like that, which in the grand scheme of things has a minimal impact on earth, maybe you should look at yourself, and fix all the shit your greedy fucking ass is causing. 

And then you go out and buy all of this cheap shit made in China, and whine and complain that China is polluting the world. Fucking idiots.

"My friend had ovarian cancer and fought it for many years. Eventually the cancer ate a hole in her bowel and even though she could have had a bowel resection she chose not to. She'd had multiple courses of chemo but they didn't work. Her partner was at the hospital night and day. 

She lived for a long time without food and just iv fluids. Over 40 days everyday was suposed to be the last, it was endless. Then they put her in a coma, but she woke up. The morphine dose should have stopped her heart... everyone was just on death watch. 

Her partner had not left the hospital for months, finally she went home and at that very time she passed away. I think sometimes Dr's or nurses do ""help along"" the process once it makes no sense to live. I don't think many of them will risk their jobs to do it in front of the family.

"*As a completely average guy, what looks percentile could he reach until it would flat out come down to genetics*

I don't really think is is quantifiable because an average that is trying can usually have a higher SMV than a nonaverage guy that isn't trying. 

I hate to say this but ""Hard work betas talent when talent doesn't work hard'  

Even the most painfully average looking and average height person can still get pretty big and lean and look very athletic from what most people do. 

The 80/20 rule (20% of men sleep with 80% of the women)... Those 20% are usually above average looking guys that are trying to look even better. There is a ton of wasted potential out there, I see it every day. Guys that don't workout at all but have insane bicep insertions, or really good looking chubby guys that would be dragon slayers if they just leaned out.

If you cannot handle the volatility of the BSE Sensex or CNX Nifty, you should consider allocating some investments into debt instruments that do not have a market risk like equities.

"First off, I am the quee of bruise-reduction.  Here's what you do- before you play, take an NSAID (anti-inflamatory medicine, for example Aleve or Ibuprofen).  Right afterwards, apply an ice pack (or two. Go buy someif you don't have any, because it's a worthy investment for this lifestyle), wrap it in a towel, ice the area (10-20 min on, 10-20 min off).  Also huge is COMPRESSION.  Get a long ace bandage and wrap it around wherever you are hurting or could bruise.  Don't wrap it too tight, but make sure there is at least a little pressure.  This will help soooo much.  You may also want to take Magnesium supplements or check to make sure you are getting enough in your food.  Mag. deficiencies make bruises (and any kind of swelling) a lot worse.  As for the toys- you may have to be willing to fork out some cash for this, especially if you want to go vegan.

"It's not 'useful information', it's a complete misrepresentation of what was actually found from the report. To quote the report:

'There are observable differences in the attributes of men and women that account for most of the wage gap. Statistical analysis that includes those variables has produced results that collectively account for between 65.1 and 76.4 percent of a raw gender wage gap of 20.4 percent, and thereby leave an adjusted gender wage gap that is between 4.8 and 7.1 percent.'

The factors that make the gap shrink to 4.8-7.1% are things like the fact that some women take time out of work to have children, meaning that they have a career gap which means they won't earn as much as they would have if they had been advancing their career during those years.

The researchers say that there may be factors unaccounted for that describe the rest of the gap (eg women putting more weight on benefits, not just wages). I'm not going to bother going through all the articles, but a cursory look suggests that they don't fit with the academic consensus on the topic.

Any confidence in the government just got flushed down the toilet with last nights curry. 
These changes only reinforce our already paranoid thinking, that we were being watched, to one of legitimate concern; fear of our very own government that is disconnected from the rest of Australian citizens needs.
 
I emailed everyone in the WA senate that I could get contact details for including the local MP. Will see what response I get... 

I also spent last night emailing an Australian company (VPNSecure.me) that runs a VPN about the new laws and how it might affect them. He stated: 
""*We are an Australian company ourselves we are yet to see full meta data collection required if that does happen in the future which at this stage seems likely... this will only affect our services in Australia I.e the Australian VPN server which will be the case for any company with a VPN in Australia based on the current unlegislated material floating around.*""

And: ""*If worse comes to worse we will move our company from Australia to a safe location to protect our users.*""

In the last 24hours I have changed my default search engine to DuckDuckGo on all my devices and signed up to try out VPN. I also put in a application for dual Passport. I too didn't imagine this country heading down this path.

"Good luck to you! You're in a situation that no one should have to find themselves in, but many unfortunately do. The suggestions here so far are all phenomenal. What I could add is that your son will be fine. Tell yourself that and take reasonable steps to make it happen. You know or are quickly learning what it takes to make that happen, and you know or will hopefully learn that laying awake in bed worrying about it won't do anything extra. In fact it'll make you worse at managing it the next day, because when you're tired you make silly mistakes. And you're less vigilant. And you're more prone to be stuck inside your own head worrying rather than watching and doing what you're really supposed to be doing with your four year old, which is enjoying the time together. 

Another important thing you can consider doing early is getting your son involved in understanding his diabetes and making good decisions about management. That doesn't mean he should be a mini endocrinologist by 10, but counting carbs can start to be a game, at least at a rudimentary level. As far as the meals go and deciding insulin with food, as was said elsewhere, dose for all the food he eats, or whatever regimen your endo suggests. With the not eating what you expect scenario, I'd collaborate with him before about how much he wants to eat. Let him know that if he decides not to eat that much that he has to drink ___ amount of juice, or whatever substitute that you have, but that once he decides then that's how many carbs he's eating. That'll force him to learn about portioning in a way, and also get used to the hard decisions that come with the disease he unfortunately has to deal with.

The whole thing is a lot for any kid to deal with, but he's at a point where he has to one way or another, just like you do. Try to make games of things where possible, try to bring levity to the situation if you can, but make sure that he gets the skills as fast and as well as is reasonable for his age. I once knew a guy who had to call his mom into college to get help with dosing and dealing with bad situations. Starting early and reasonably will help him own this and help him not be the person in the checkout line. 

Last I'd say take care of yourself. Caregivers deal with a lot of stress that often isn't acknowledged. Make sure you take the time you need to do what you find enjoyable and that gets your mind off of this tough situation. I know this is a frantic reddit post, but consider seeing a therapist too if you need to. It seems like you're worrying a lot about the near and distant future, and might be a good idea to get some specific strategies to deal with that worry. 

Finally, rely on us! We've all dealt with diabetes in some way, shape, or form (T1, T2, caregivers, friends, etc), many of us for a long time. There's a steep learning curve, but in the internet age you don't have to do it alone.",false,false,t1_cn07b5y,jsfuller13,T1 2007,0,1419046577,t5_2qhsj,t3_2ptu3i,t3_2ptu3i,2,1425307139,0,0,cn07b5y,diabetes,2,,T1,

"Hip-Hop/Rap isn't just a form of political/social expression, but also a cultural form of expression. Maybe you could elaborate, because I don't really understand how that's ridiculous. Hip-Hop has maintained its relevance because it speaks to young people (whether socially, politically, or culturally). Art is about self expression. Celebration (partying) is self expression, it's definitely not antithetical to Hip-Hop. Hip-Hop started out in the late 70's as dance music, but there's always been an underlying theme of black consciousness too (""the Message""). 

I agree that not every rapper does (or should try to) include a political/social message in their music, but that doesn't mean you can't get anything political out of it. For some people, partying is the only way to cope. If I can't change anything, fuck it, I might as well pop a molly and enjoy myself because how long am I gonna live anyways... A guy like Young Thug doesn't talk about politics, but he can't escape it either. From his flamboyant style of dressing to his lyrics which often include themes of drug use and sex, there's so much to talk about. A discussion about Thug could encompass so many issues (sexuality, masculinity, fashion, drug use, misogyny, etc.). Just by existing and expressing himself, he's starting these conversations. 

I agree with you on Iggy. It's not really that she's a white Australian female rapper that bothers me. It's the fake southern accent. It's also the Wall Street Journal saying she runs rap which is hilarious (but I'm not sure how much editorial say she or her publicist had over that BS).

"&gt; I have a right to interject when someone addresses the entire gender of men like we're all lying in wait to harass and cajole the women folk.

No one is doing that. If you're addressing some unknown but significant number of individuals in a group, you address the group as a whole. As others have already pointed out, addressing the group as a whole doesn't mean you're accusing every individual in that group. No one is accusing *you* personally of being sexist or rude to women.

&gt; Why not approach the issue in a constructive or logical manner instead of just saying ""wow those dumb men need to get their their act together.""

The first step to fixing the problem is acknowledging that there is one, and it's hard to move beyond that point because people like you start throwing a fit whenever the issue is brought up. Instead of focusing on the big picture of women being made to feel unwelcome in the Magic community, people like you continually derail the conversation into NAMALT (""not  ALL men are like that"") territory, which is irrelevant and prevents us from discussing the actual problem.

"The only thing you get from adding testosterone to a body that already naturally produces it is heightened aggression. Increased musculature and lowered body fat is a lie, especially if you're over 20 years old. As for increased libido you put a hell of a lot of strain on your prostate so you'll probably end up being sterile. Just saying. The reason cross-sex hormone treatment works is because while you add one type, you suppress the other. You can't just add more testosterone. Your body doesn't work like that. You can't suppress your bodies naturally produced estrogen anymore than it is because it's quite low in men compared to naturally produced testosterone in FAMB (females assigned at birth). Now if you were a woman trying to increase her estrogen levels you may have more success with mood regulation  since your testosterone goes down, but you won't grow bigger breasts. The effects you see in trans* people from hormones are because it's cross-sex, and your body undergoes a second puberty, but it doesn't work like that for cis people. I'm sorry but the science doesn't work like that. And I too apologize for coming off as rude. It's a good question, really. The reason that steroids work isn't because you're physically adding testosterone, but because you're adding certain solutions to your body that encourage it to naturally produce more testosterone.

I had a really good family growing up and still do.   It is pretty damn awesome and I am aware of it.   There are so many kids with no family at all.  I can't imagine how my life would have turned out without infinite support from family.  Why bring another unwanted kid into a world that already has so many to take care of.   Which is more evil-- Hoping those who ultimately decide against abortion take responsibility and raise their children,  or allowing them to decide for it?

"Considering that capitalism is driving the world on an unrelenting path of ever increasing profits, my guess is that you will see fads and hypes come along at an ever increasing pace.

On the other hand, technological development is more unpredictable. You can plan a marketing campaign, and you can plan research, and you cannot plan when some invention or breaktrhough will happen, nor can you really predict when it will become economically profitable. Which is the metric things are measured by the model that most investors trust.

On the gripping hand, once a technology, technique, scientific theory or in general a good idea gets traction, it won't go away, *ever*. Or at least until it is surpassed by something better.

So worthless fads fade away, while worthful changes in the way people look at the world and/or themselves are likely to stick around, together with the technology and infrastructure that makes them possible. The worthless fads will compete for our attention in an ever increasing rate, driven by the greed of companies who believe that their worthless fad might in fact be the next worthful addition to mankind.

"Everything else in this thread is pretty much true, but I think the best way to put it (rather than making it consoles specific) is that over time, we get better at writing efficient code.

For example, if you want to do ""perfect"" lighting, you have to do it in one way (the perfect way), and that won't change/get significantly easier. If instead you want ""good"" lighting, you can cut all sorts of corners when writing the code to make it.

We are constantly getting better at cutting corners while still making things look good. An example on the PC of this would be Minecraft's recent update - they found a way to easily not render elements not on the screen, making the game run a lot smoother.

Consoles provide a nice, static platform that video game makers can consistently optimise for, but such optimisations also happen on other platforms too - they are just less noticeable because their specifications change over time.

As a good example Crysis 2 is (usually) much easier to run on PC than Crysis 1 is...

"Cheesing is super easy. I prefer legit because it's a damn fun fight, but I don't mind cheesing if the PUG I'm in can't get their shit together.

Easiest way (imo) is to have the glitcher fly in solo, invite everyone to the game and revive. Then start the fight like normal but wait for Crota to go to the right. Glitcher hits the Xbox button (XB1, not sure of the equivalent ways on other systems), start button, then hover over the quit button. As soon as the shields go down, everyone yells gogogo, glitcher quits, Crota stays down. No need for pulling the ethernet or turning the system off.

I say to let him go to the right because you only have one set of boomers to worry about and it's a shorter run to Crota for the sword user. Never had to use more than one sword over there.

That being said, DON'T DO THAT CRAP! It's because this cheese exists that I can't find any competent PUGs for the fight and everyone gives up after one wipe.

"I can only recommend [obal's PvE DPS builds for guardians](http://www.reddit.com/message/messages/2rosul). Normally I'm running a 4/5/0/0/4 GS/S+F built with retreat (extra mibility and a block), purging flames (extra DPS + condi removal) and save yourseselves/stand your ground (depending on situation). Heal skill is shelter for me and renewed focus as elite. For me this totals to about:

2 Blocks (retreat + f3)

3 blocks from focus 5

4 blinds from GS 3, focus 4, sword 2 and f1

2 seconds blocking from shelter

2 seconds invulnerability from elite

another block/blind from f1/f3 after the elite

#2 dodges

If you time everything correctly you can add another 2 dodges if you use the first ones at the beginning.

Never had much of a problem with that build and worked great for me (atleast for PvE/Dungeons). Gives great DPS, lots of condi removal, some blocks for the party, projectile reflection from the sword (and if you use stand your ground also stability). Flame legion runes are a cheap alternative and viable in comparions the scholar runes. No problems with survivability and full zerker for me.

So they try to get me to see the errors of my ways and join their religion (or even a religion they didn't belong to just so I would believe something)

I tend to focus on the methods used to teach a person something and make them see that there seems to be a large difference between secular- and religious teaching (and off course other absolute doctrines that they do not belong to). 

Then ask them how they were taught what they believe now.

Some stopped questioning me because the ideas I made them think made them uncomfortable and others started to ask even more questions. Those, I notched along a bit more.

"Cool so from the comments let's lay out what we know.

- PCs work for a nameless Mercenary Company, who is scheming to do something ""EVIL"" that the players will want to stop eventually... eventually. 

- Human Barons control 1 part of the land. The other part is closed off to the Elves (who I assume no one will be playing). Maybe their kingdom lies beyond a forest which is enchanted to always cause travellers to get lost... who knows. 

So let's plan out what you need to do. I'll just roll with what I would have done.

**Structure of the Human-Lands.**

5 Barons control the land. They are ""allied"", because this makes things easier, but what they all want is complete control. Not because a unified land is better, but because their egos are fragile and they constantly need to dominate everything to validate their own existence, whose importance has been hyper-inflated by their aristocratic upbringing &amp; conditioning. 

**1. Figure out what the Mercenary Company wants to do that's so evil.** 

Every Baron is involved in some form of illegal activity (Human trafficking, drugs, gambling, spying, etc.) that they would not want found out. The commander of the Mercenary Company is allied with a particular Human Baron (referred to as X) to help him/her attain complete dominion over all Humans, then all Elves. 

**2. How will they accomplish this?**

X will want to expose the illegal activity of his competitors, causing the people to themselves to throw them out of power. The most efficient way.

The other Barons will fight for the exposed land, or a rival noble will take over. Whatever the case is... X will not intervene yet. 

If exposing the illegal activity isn't enough, then pinning them against each other is the next best thing. Make it so Baron A thinks Baron B stole the cargo. Or perhaps Baron C is known for his love of ""freedom &amp; liberty"", so Baron D assumes he is responsible for freeing the slaves... you can do a lot. 

**3. How will the PCs play along?**

Obviously they won't know all of this. They're simple mercenaries working for the gold. We need something to get them personally involved. 

Their first assignment was easy: They carried an important letter to Baron C's estate. It is sealed, so they can't read it without Baron C knowing. Quick and easy, thieves on the road caused a bit of trouble but that's it: a good way to test the waters.

Their second assignment had them follow up on that letter. They go back to Baron C's estate and escort some cargo to Baron A's estate. They don't know this, but their Mercenary Leader had some of his right-hand-men dress up and raid the caravan, making sure not to kill any of the PCs. The caravan held cargo of flesh, slaves, and the ""raiders"" will be sure to be heard saying ""Baron D offers his sympathies. Go forth and be free."" This was the first step in pinning Baron C against Baron D. 

So now the PCs know something's up. They don't know that their Mercenary Leader is behind it, or that he's allied with Baron X. 

From here on out it's up to you. I planned my campaign out similar to this: A lot of conspiring, ultimate political plans, important figures playing against each other, etc. So far it's been nice. It's hard for them to figure anything out at first, but as people die things become clearer.

"&gt;how is the post-left actually opposed to identity politics?

These identities are at their core a social product.  Social constructions.  They exist because people behave as though they exist.  

Race and gender are not biological truths but rather sets of rolls, expectations, behaviors, and a certain position within the social hierarchy all of which are produced and reproduced socially.  That is they are a product of human interactions and as spooks they continue to mediate these social interactions. 

Patriarchy, white supremacy and such do not exist because they are inherent to human sociability (we know this anthropologically and historically to be true) but are rather an aggregate of modern human activity.

Their existence is social (they were constructed) and only as such do they have material consequences for the people subject to those identities.  

That is, people are not a gender but are socially gendered.  They are racialized.  They are othered.  The subaltern category is defined through social interaction and the people subject to them are placed within a social hierarchy and limited by these identities.  These identities are often how capital makes subjects out of us.

In other words these identities are in and of themselves restrictive.  

The identity politician then, is one who would affirm these identities.  It is a positive orientation toward the subaltern category and one that reproduces it if only reformed while anarchy or communism (I would argue) demands the proliferation of different forms of life and an opening up of the full range of expression.

Gender abolition means discarding that god awful gender binary once and for all and appreciating that instead of a binary, what we actually have is a range or spectrum of expressions and sexualities even within individuals themselves. 

This opening up and making common is what I would call a communist expression.  Communism is not a program, an economic model, or a set of ideals to be realized.  I would argue it is the opposite of those things in allowing the individual to engage in the production of the self as they see fit absent the coercive and ordering effects of abstractions such as the economy and the state.

"Samething happened to me bro.

My girlfriend told me who it was and immediately got filled with rage because it was someone I thought was my friend. 

I can tell you this: one thing I regret is seeing him face to face and not having the courage to beat the shit out of him. I told him of, bitched at him, but pussied out and didn't do anything about it and that scenario replays in my head every once in a while and it frustrates me. By the way the guy is some skinny fucker and a pussy since he was frightened when I was bitching at him so Im confident I would've destroyed him since I played football, went to the gym, and however im not ripped or big but have strength. But to this day I hate how I didn't man up. Although I've never gotten in a fight in my life and im usually really nice and calm, I feel that it should've been a moment were I should've done it. I feel like a pussy so my advice is: kick his ass if you know who it and haven't done it yet and although it wont help with the pain she caused you, you could always smile remembering how you made him pay. Also, your best friends will be a huge help. But dont just go to any friend because they wont do nothing, go to your real close best friends who have been there your whole life.

Also if it helps, my girlfriend and I are currently working on our relationship and managed to savior it and managed to stay together. She really loves me and regrets doing it and suffered for months after I had left her when that happened. She learned her lesson and I managed to forgive her since I also did my mistakes and she took me back. Part of me is still hurt because of it but i know that pain only gets you stronger.

The positive side of it. It feels really good to pay off the mortgage. Having absolutely no debt is very liberating. It frees up a lot of cash flow and is allowing me to reach financial independence somewhat early in my life. If I had to make the decision today I would do it again.

"Awesome looking bike!  I'd probably swap a single narrow-wide ring up front.  

Also, the HR is a little slower rolling than the Ardent up front and almost unnecessary out back.  Swap a 2.2 Ikon out back if you want a really lightweight tire or a 2.35 Ikon if you want almost the same level of grip as the Ardent but at less weight and far less rolling resistance.  

I think the 2.3 HR2 front and 2.35 Ikon rear is my favorite tire setup ever.  Super predictable over a wide range of trail conditions, rolls really well and grips like hell at all lean angles.  The rear Ikon sets up for a nice drift right before the front HR2 starts to slide so it's really fun/easy to get into a controlled two wheel drift around loose turns.

Each district, school, even class room has their own social dynamic. I was in the same school district for my public education. I made a good friend later in life who was an army brat: he went to seven or eight different schools. I recall comparing notes, and his perspective was that it doesn't matter who you are: classes &amp; teachers will sometimes accept you or they'll reject you. 

It takes the effort of the admins, teachers &amp; parents to be involved, and that, generally, is asking too much. Budgets are cut, people with political agendas find their way in, and some parents have other things going on in their lives, or too many kids to keep track of.

"Hey, I'm not the one you asked but I'm from Germany, too. I don't think it causes self loathing. We talk about it as something humans did, maybe our grandparents did. We talk about the politics, the opressors, the counterpart. People tell stories they heared from their relatives, some may even bring something to class which relates to the third reich. There is no denying, we accept it as part of our past, because it is a part of it and we know that there is nothing we can do to take it back but that we are responsible to not let it happen again. I had the luck that there was an old lady who survived the Warsaw Ghetto and who visited our school to talk about her experiences and to answer questions.
In Germany all schools have an Aula, an assembly room, about as big as a gym, where the final exams take place and general schoolstuff like big annoucements happen. This lady came and the Aula was packed full with pupils. There were no seats left and the doors had to be open because everyone wanted to listen what the lady had to say. When the first person who wanted to ask her a question spoke and apologised for what happened to her she told us not to blame us and that she was very glad that so many young people were interested in what she had to say and that this was something so important because we wanted to know and listen and build a better future with our knowledge and acceptance. This gathering was after classes had ended and nobody had to stay. We just went if we wanted to and the whole school wanted to listen.

"Yup. Nobody starts off being able to sing good C5s. Everything from range to tone only comes after practice unless you happen to be gifted. For example, Brandon flowers had to tell to his G# on the killers' first album, but in later years he had no trouble singing B4s and higher after seeing a vocal coach.

My connection's too weak atm to check out the videos, but I'm willing to bet they are singing in mix. Like I said, if you work on it a lot your mix will sound very strong. Listen to bruce Springsteen in dancing in the dark or backstreets to hear Gs and G#s in pure chest voice. It's a huge amount of strain and yelling. Mix is more relaxed because you lighten up on chest without giving it up completely. 

I'm not saying baritones can't mix. It's just generally not a significant part of their singing. Placido Domingo, world class tenor, switched to baritone repertoire in his later years. He definitely still mixed, just not to the extent of his tenor roles.
Same thing with tenors and yelling. Sure it's doable, but it's still very uncomfortable and you still will never make it to A4 with anything performance worthy and reliable.

"&gt; Beth was a weak character, that is why she tried to kill herself. The fact that she got over that shows she is strong. 

Maybe in this reality, but not within the universe of the show. She was never shown defending or taking care of herself. All she did was choose not to kill herself and then take up space for two seasons.


&gt;Beth takes care of the babies because someone has to. 

So does Carol. But that's not the only thing she does. 

&gt;It is required, does that make Tyreese weak? 

Again, that's not the only thing he does. The only thing Beth was shown doing was taking care of Judith and other boring things for most of every episode since they got to the prison. She served no purpose. 

&gt;Also, we have seen Beth fight and protect herself and others. 

When. Seriously name a scene. She has no agency in the early episodes of the show, and if she's shown fighting its because it's a scene where everyone else is fighting, too, not because she's in danger and has chosen to fight. It's because she has to in those scenes, and is told to by a stronger character.


&gt;Which also takes courage. 

You're confusing agency (which Beth lacked until episode) with taking action when necessary.

&gt;Just because she is not at the center of the conflict does not mean she is not involved. 

She's not involved. Name a conflict she was involved in that was her own

&gt;She held her own when she was running around with Daryl. 

Yeah, that's why he taught her everything about everything and felt like he was her protector and caretaker. 

&gt;Again, she did nothing new in that episode. 

Yes, she did. She took action independent of direction from the influence of other characters because she knew what needed to be done, unlike in episodes from the past where she just followed everyone else's lead.

&gt;She did not kill anyone, she defended herself which she has done in the past. It just so happens that person died. That is not a measure of someones strength.

She did kill someone by putting them in a situation in which their death was certain, but you're ignoring what actually took place in last week's episode to make your point. In this episode beth acted with *autonomy*, which is what she had been lacking in the first place. 

&gt; If the Governor was straightforward evil, he would not have created Woodbury. Was he a good man? No. But he was not pure evil, he just saw our heroes as a hurdle. 

 The Governor aggressively attacked anyone that came within his camp for no reason. He actively sought people out and murdered them, even when they weren't a threat. And then he stored the heads of those people in his closet. And he played on his people's fears to rally them against an exaggerated enemy. And then he killed his people when he didn't get his way. He literally murdered an entire camp of people because he was having a bad day. And his entire character arc in season four revolved around his utter ruthlessness in seeking revenge against Rick *for a loss that he himself caused.* And when given a second chance he again chooses badly by even mobilizing his new camp against Rick's prison. 

&gt;Neither were the Termites, they were victims of circumstance that lost their way. They may be weaker than Rick's group but not evil. 

That is such a mealy-mouthed excuse for choosing to eat people that I don't even know where to begin in attacking your argument. They led people down the primrose path with the promise of sanctuary, trapped them, and killed and ate them. That's fucked up. That's a hell of a way to lose your way. The termites are more evil than the Governor. 


&gt;The Grady camp seems to be doing pretty well for being weak. They have better living conditions that Rick's group, that's for sure.

You're ignoring what real weakness is. The Grady camp is weak because it allows for a system that takes advantage of its members weaknesses instead of their strengths. The reason the people at Grady seek weak people is because the group isn't strong enough to survive the presence of strong personalities. It needs people that are unable to take independent action and that will just ride things out because it's preferable to dying, and the kind of people that would willingly set up a system like that are weak by nature. Those people aren't leaders.

Dawn is weak because she lets her subordinates do whatever they want with the hopes that they all will survive. The doctor is weak because he's too much of a wimp to actually follow through on what's right and instead does what is easy. Everyone else in the camp is weak because they were specifically selected for their weaknesses. Duh, hello. You're missing the entire point. I don't think this show could be more heavy handed in this particular plot line.

&gt; If you believe that growth is just how willing you are to kill from season to season that is fine, but I expect more. 

Did you even read my argument?

&gt;I have seen Beth fight back along with everyone else in Rick's group so to say you only learned that last week is curious. 

Again, this has to do with autonomy, not just with ""fighting back."" Beth thought up her own scheme to escape and then acted on her plan. That's not something we've seen Beth do in the past. That's a huge piece of character development that you are ignoring.

&gt;The point of that episode was to introduce a new villain. I didn't learn anything new about Beth or what drives her. Did you expect her to just accept whatever role the hospital needed her to take? Did you expect her to be a yes man to Grady? Did you expect her to let herself be raped? If so then she did grow in your eyes, but if not then how is her doing what you expected growth?

Yes, because up until this point Beth has been a background character that just follows the lead of others. We have not seen her in a situation where she was faced with danger on her own, and where she would be forced to come up with a solution herself. You're reading characterization into this character that isn't there if you're ignoring her lack of agency until this episode.

"Many people do not know it, but the Qunari who live in Par Vollen have a scientific comprehension that rivals any on Thedas; the Arigena (""the Mind of the Qun""), is advanced indeed. The future inquisitor, a qunari born in these lands, realized one overly warm summer's day that that the approach of demanding local gauge invariance worked well with regards to the Electromagnetic and Strong force; but using it for weak-force interactions didn’t seem to work, as the approach mathematically yielded massless gauge fields (bosons), but the Arigena's particle detectors had already allowed for the discovery that weak force bosons must have a mass. 

Not able to reason a solution to this obvious dilemma, the Qunari wandered into the desert. There he sat in the shade of a great rock, determined to either come upon the solution, or die of thirst. The qunari recalled that proton/neutron isospin symmetry SU(2) plus local gauge invariance yielded three massless vector bosons, and the U(1) symmetry in electromagnetics yielded a single massless boson (photon) which couples to charged particles. So too, the SU(2)L weak interaction symmetry similarly yielded three massless vector bosons W = (W1, W2, W3) that couple to the weak isospin doublets.

The day grew hotter, and the Qunari had all of the tools he needed to realize the truth that had so long escaped the Qun, but inspiration did not come. Then, just before the last drop of moisture fell from his lips, a great wave of bosons rose up from the sand, light reflecting from the sun as it moved out from behind a cloud, and the Qunari's eyes were opened.

All that was required was to postulate the existence of a new spin-0 field with a potential equal to mu-squared (phi-hermitian-phi) + lambda (phi-hermitian-phi)-squared. This in itself would allow for spontaneous symmetry breaking in the relevant force, and the implied mathematical transformation would resolve the attributes of the derived bosons with the force carrier bosons discovered in the particle detectors of his home people.

And so the Qunari left the land of his birth and went forward to the people of Thedas (so he could stop thinking about grad school for just a little while).

"Good questions. Let me take them one by one. 

I'll first say that the portfolio is the only truly important thing. When I first came out to NYC to work, I interviewed at 17 different companies/startups/studios. Not a single one even looked at or asked about the school I went to. We just talked at length about my projects. That being said, I think design school is important. Design is complicated. There's a lot to learn. I know people who swear by just going it your own way and not going to school. Those people don't see what they don't do well. They struggle with the fine details. They think their work is fine, but they haven't figured out why it could be better. 

Design school taught me a lot. It taught me how to think differently. How to get thick skin and take critique. How to work with grids. How to manage type. All of these skills don't come from hard and fast rules. They come from ethereal concepts that you have to learn. They're much easily learned through someone who can mentor you. You can figure it out on your own, but it will take longer. The cap on your ability to grow in the industry will fall short. I've even interviewed people who had some nice work, but when I discussed with them their process or their theory, they didn't know what they were talking about. They learned how to copy good work, but not how to generate their own creative output. 

If you want practice here's what I would do. 

1. Sketch.  Even if you aren't good at it. I'm still not. Lot's of designers aren't. Sketching is about a quick method of generating ideas. 

2. Read and write. Design is about communication, not visuals. Visuals are important, but if they don't say anything, no one cares. Great designers often tend to be great writers/readers. Don't just read about design. Read about architecture. Read about theater. Read Science Fiction. Just read. 

3. Take pictures. Learn to frame a shot. learn how to compose something beautiful. 

4. Fill your well. Your greatest resource in design will be culture. Learn about things. Experience a full life. If your creative inspiration comes from a design website, you're doing it partially wrong (those things have their value, but they are a simple tool, not a means to good solutions). Dig deep into different things and become broadly experienced. 

5. Play with the software. If you're sketching, try the software too. Learn Photoshop, Illustrator and InDesign. This leads to my next thing. 

6. Find good work and copy it. Literally. Don't copy to give to a client. Just copy in the privacy of your own studio space. You learn to play the guitar by first playing songs by bands you love. Do the same with design. Copy their work and try to learn their techniques. 

Regarding whether I practice, I do. Side projects are a big part of what we do. Client work is always constrained by their needs. Side projects are a good way to push your creativity. Working with constraints is good and important, but balance it with side projects. Design an app. Make a children's book. Do whatever it is that seems interesting to you. 

I still struggle with whether my work is good or not. You'll never get over expecting more than you can deliver. If you like the challenge of that and can live with yourself, you'll be a good designer. A good part of knowing what's good is learning to see. Study masters. Find out what makes good work tick. This is a hard question for sure. This is part of why I tell people to go do design school. 

Design books I recommend... this is hard. A few to get started...

[Grid Systems](http://www.amazon.com/Systems-Graphic-Systeme-Visuele-Gestaltung/dp/3721201450/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1404838256&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=grid+systems) is bland but essential. Learn it. By one of the great masters. 

[Art &amp; Visual Perception](http://www.amazon.com/Bonos-Thinking-Course-Revised-Edition/dp/0816031789/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1404838229&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=DeBono%27s+THinking+course) is also mega heavy, but will teach you how to understand how good creative work is composed and why it works. Very interesting if you can take it. 

[A Smile in the Mind](http://www.amazon.com/A-Smile-Mind-Beryl-McAlhone/dp/0714838128/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1404838401&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=a+smile+in+the+mind) is a great book that shows how wit and messaging in design makes for powerful and memorable work. It's a good primer on how designers work concept into their visuals. It's about discovery and the bliss that comes from that (that's why our honey bottles were so successful... discovery is everything). 

Also check out www.designersandbooks.com. It's a long running list of great books that are recommended by designers much more skilled than I am. These are the greats.

"yeah that's a really good point. but also maybe they just selected the ones that were offenders. like all the things you said could explain why some (most?) pedophiles *offend* but maybe not why they're pedophiles to begin with. maybe it could explain some of that as well but i'm not sure. for all we know the ones that don't offend are normal in all these areas and the offenders among them aren't representative of the group as a whole. shorter height, lower IQ,  and lefthandedness, are just the things that could lead to ostracization or bad judgement - risk factors for offending. 

i'm wondering how they found these pedophiles to submit to the neuroimaging and the rest of the tests. maybe it was like surveys or questionnaires, but why's someone who's never done anything wrong and isn't going to, going to risk identifying themselves as a pedophile? maybe it's confidential. the questionnaire, their participation in the study. all confidential. but still, why participate? if you're doing okay, not harming anyone, not wanting to, why revisit this thing you're managing quite fine on your own.

there is that theory that attraction to kids and especially adolescents is not that uncommon. maybe its expression is just suppressed a lot. by being considered really bad and thought of as despicable. by there being severe consequences to it. this could cause people not to do it, it could even cause them to be conditioned not to think of it, to reject it. so what would it take for that not to happen? desperation. what's uncommon is not the attraction but the attraction in addition to the rejection by wider society. that's what leads people to act on the attraction.

this is the ""latent in all of us"" theory. that the potential is there in a lot of us, but that it takes a lot of weaknesses -cognitive ones, social ones, physical ones, and accumulated failure - to bring out the deviancy.

"For some things it really is about the quality though, to a certain degree. Like buying a pair of chippewas over a pair of boots from dsw. The chippewas will undoubtedly last much longer than those dsw boots, and be fairly cheap at about $130 compared to the $80 or so for discount boots. The chippewas will last many years longer. But when we start talking about boots at the $400+ price points the ability to last is much less relevant because you can find that ability in cheaper boots too, albeit not as long lasting but you see diminishing marginal returns when you go up the price scale. Its all about looks and how well the boots hold that look, chippewas leather looks pretty bad relatively quickly while good Calfskin will generally keep its looks. price really is about what you said in your comment in large part when talking about leather outside of shell cordovan which can last practically forever on a well made boot.

Someone cutting in front of you at low speeds is creating an unsafe situation which you cannot be expected to mitigate, which is why it is their fault.

Let's say you approach a traffic light, and the light is out. Which means it's a 4 way stop rule. Let's say you proceed through the light and another driver doesn't see the light is out, they don't stop, and hits you.

It's your fault, even though you had the right of way, as you have to assume the other driver doesn't see the light.

"Those polls are hilariously misleading.  Gun control advocates framed the issue as ""Do you support background checks?""  It's like saying ""Do you support education?""  So of course 90% of respondents say ""yes"".  

Background checks are already in place.  You buy a gun from a dealer and you have to complete the ATF form 4473, swear under penalty of perjury that you aren't a convicted felon, drug addict or mental deficient, and then have your name and social phoned into the NICS background check system operated by the FBI. 

You don't have to complete a background check if you buy your brother Bob's shotgun in a *private sale*, in the same way that anyone is freely allowed to dispose of his private property as he sees fit.  By the same token, if Bob knowingly sells you that shotgun despite your status as a felon, he has committed a crime. There's no ""loophole"" there.  There is no ""gun show loophole"" either, because those are predicated on private sales.  Dealers who sell at gun shows still have to conduct background checks.  

What progressives were **really** proposing is that all gun transfers of any kind be documented in a Federal database.  Private sale, inheritance, etc would all be reported to the Feds, effectively creating in a national registry.  But that would be a ridiculous and overreaching infringement, so they just framed the question with the reductive phrase ""Do you support background checks?""

"I was pretty good at Halo 2.  I started out being really bad.  I would actually get negative scores because I would fall off the level sometimes.

1) Spend time by yourself or with your friends jumping around the maps and doing silly stuff.  Playing more gives you greater control of your character.

2) Know your basics.  Weapon spawn locations.  BXR.  Noob combo (plasma pistol).  Basic Jump Tactics.  

3) HEADSHOTS.  This is so important it is not even funny.  it'll take you 4 shots to kill someone with a BR.  It'll take you like 12 if you don't get any headshots.

5) If you wanna get really good in a clan with serious matches, you gotta learn to call out where enemies are when you see them.  ""2 in the library heading up""  or  ""1 coming up the lift no shields no shields"" 

6) If you wanna get really good as an individual you gotta practice a lot.  Practice BXR, BXRRX, BXRRX YY RRX, RRX YY RRX.  Double shooting is pretty hard but gives you a significant advantage in a BR off.  To make the most of double shooting you kinda have to claw your controller, but most people don't do this.  Practice your no scopes when you can, stickies, just anything in general that will make you play better as an individual.

7) Jump Tactics Advanced.  Learn to get around the map.  No joke. There are so many ways to get around Lockout and Ivory Tower.

You also kind of have to have the desire to be a better player.  The kind of player who has the option to use to sword, but just holds it in their secondary and doesn't use it because they think the games more fun that way.

edit:  Also sensitivity is so important.  When I started I thought I was pro or cool because I wanted to play with 10 sensitivity.  Start yourself at 1 or 2 and slowly build your way up to 4 or 5ish.  This will help you with headshots.

Also when aiming, A LOT of times when you want to aim slight left or right, just move left and right.

Also when coming around corners when you know there is an enemy, try jumping.  It throws them off a lot.  Aiming up quickly at the head is hard.

Also when you are about to get noob combo'd, duck.  Its weird that it does, but it works for some reason.

Also crouch punching is useful in some situations.

"A lot of big grocery chains no longer cut their own meat due to cost and efficiency reasons. It's been this way for nearly a decade now in the top volume tiers. The company I work for is *definitely* at the forefront of top volume.

So, one day I get a phone call and right off the bat, I get this obviously red necky, wife beating, piece of garbage yelling through the phone so loud it stresses the speaker to the point where his words are inaudible at times. 

He had come in and was upset we were out of a certain cut of steak (this was late in the day on a major grilling holiday weekend btw), and demanded that our meat person go cut him one. He informed him that we don't cut the meat there, but that he would look in the stock room to see if we had any more (any non-mentally deficient person would know instantly that we would most likely not.) While he was waiting he took the time out to tell other customers how idiotic and worthless my employees were. This is where it gets fun. Another employee from a nearby area comes up to the guy and says, ""I'm sorry Sir, but we're not a butcher shop,"" in his calm, meek voice. Ricky Redneck then *flips the fuck out* ""who the fuck do you think you are to talk to me like that?!"" He's now screaming at the top of his lungs, and his wife has to lead him out of the store. 40ish minutes later after getting home, he calls me, asking me if we train our employees to be rude, or if we even train them at all. He demands we fire Mr. Meek, and that if he sees him there again, he'll sue.

"&gt;Your wording betrays your own bias. Someone simply ""points out"" someone with a similar belief, and someone else ""screams"" in disagreement.

and are you not biased either? of course you are.  So? I'm not a journalist for state tv, I don't need to remain neutral, I can take a side.  I do not agree with modern feminism.

&gt;Nobody is arguing that there are extremists in....they simply aren't relevant to the discussion

That's a fair point, I know many self identified feminists in real life, who I agree with a lot of their views, that doesn't correspond to the people you discuss with on the internet, unfortunately with all groups it's the vocal minority that most people hear.

&gt;That's why it's a strawman.

It's a strawman if it's a a complete construct of the opposing speaker, and used to pretty much change subject.  This was not happening here, he was not debating, but rather voicing a concern he had in general, and based on many of the 'feminist' comments usually on reddit, *cough* SRS *cough*, this is a reasonable place to voice it.  

&gt;Because this is not a debate.

Then why do you get to call out fallacies but not me?

&gt;Ad hominem: You're wrong because you're an idiot.
Not ad hominem: You're wrong and you're an idiot.

You never said you were wrong and you are an idiot, you just said you are an idiot, and to avoid ad hominem you would need to validate that claim of wrongness.  As you said, this isn't a debate, and therefor you hold no burden.  That doesn't make it any less an ad hominem.  You say that it isn't a debate and therefor you are apparently 'immune' to fallacies, such as attacking him, yet you call ""star feminist' as a fallacy in the same comment.  Either fallacies are limited to debates or they are not, you can't cherry pick when it's convenient for you (another fallacy).

&gt;Hahahahahahaha you're not much better than he is.

I won't pretend to be as I don't know him.

"Huh.. Trying to break two 500€ notes in the middle of a Spanish nowhere (biggish market, though, like your normal-sized Carrefour with maybe 40 cash registers).

Don't ask, I am thick.
Results? Well, tell you one thing: the Spanish don't let themselves be taken for a ride. The amount of careful attention given to each of these fucking bills was truly astonishing. Paintings don't go through that much scrutiny at Sotheby's. The reaction of each of the cashiers was identical: both started phoning someone on this internal phone they have, without saying a word to us. Both queues were stalled, obviously, and the whole charade got enough attention that it was obvious to anyone in that store that we were trying to pull something off. A special person was called with a bill detector of sorts. A couple of times security (I presume) was consulted over the internal phone. Eventually, I think (or my imagination is helping me) somebody rolled in with some portable Fort Knox to properly receive the precious bond and dispatch us the change. Oh yeah, both of us, separately.

"As a 51 year old guy who recently returned to full time study I can tell you what I have done as opposed to my behaviour the first time I was a college student 35 years ago. 

Time management is the most important thing. Start on assignments as soon as you get them. Work on everything a little bit at a time. Otherwise you will end up doing things at the last minute and the results will be shite. 

Sit in the front of the lectures and ask questions. If you don't understand something ask. If you don't understand something, chances are at least one other person in the room doesn't either. So don't be afraid of looking dumb. You aren't in highschool anymore and anyone who still thinks that way will be graduating to serving at McDonald's so who cares.  This is another advantage of starting work early. If you don't understand something you can email them a week before, but not the night before. And don't sit in the back with the Facebookers and the gigglers. They are wasting their time and money, don't let them waste yours. 

The two most important things are writing essays and getting referencing right. If there are classes offered for this, take them. they will make your life easier.

"I would say that the standard is used to determine which action should be taken by examining the impacts of end states.  The debate then is about which world (Aff or Neg) will have the most or least utility after something is prioritized or when one action is taken in conflict with another.  This of course assumes that you have proven that moral action can be based on a prediction of what will or will likely happen.  Bias from subjective experience like privilege or oppression makes this somewhat morally shaky.  Try to go with Rawls veil of ignorance and talk about how people would want society to be from the original position.  I believe that Rawls ultimately agreed that people in the original position would choose util.  I would try to impact to lives lost or dehumanization.  

On a side note, the whole idea of actions or priorities being justified because of predicted outcomes always seemed vulnerable to me.  For example, since we live in a society with privilege and oppression we cannot say that the same action is moral when done by two people because their predictions of the outcomes will be biased by their own experiences of privilege or oppression.  Similarly the judge in your round may have a competing interpretation of what the outcome will be  based on his or her own subjective point of view.  Your opponent will certainly have a competing interp.  Another key weakness of expected outcomes is that the further down the timeline one looks after an action, the greater the likelihood that outcomes from one action will vacillate from good to bad.  Thus, any action could be justified using your standard and also condemned simultaneously.  This means that ends based standards can hardly be used to determine morality because the actual moral agency is not in ourselves but in an increasingly complex chain of events that will make us angels and devils depending upon the timeline or vantage point and subjective life experience of the observer after the action has occurred.  This is moral relativism.  Sorry for the rant.",false,true,t1_ciknl8b,adobefootball,,0,1404109882,t5_2rbui,t3_29fm84,t3_29fm84,4,1434473443,0,0,ciknl8b,lincolndouglas,4,,,

It's interesting how we can start to see a path from the present to this possible future. If we can finally hit a break through in fusion technology, we could one day have a society in which we have more energy than we could ever need. Of course, having all the extra energy will naturally drive us to using for something. Once we master the art of manipulating matter and energy on the atomic and quantum scales, we'll be one step closer to replicator technology.   

 Replicators will be what finally enables the Star Trek style economy. I think the author glossed over that point a little bit. We'll still need raw materials (like, say, hydrogen) but eventually every resource will be worth the same amount and anything we need can be created from energy.

For getting the timbre of what you want right, just get it ""close enough"" for you to get the idea down, and then you can tweak it (am I guessing correctly that you're using a MIDI keyboard and making electronic stuff?).

As for getting the right notes themselves, you should just keep practicing and learn as much theory as you can. It'll help in the long run. You could also sing it into a mic and then it's saved forever and you can take as long as you want to actually get it through your guitar/keyboard/whatever.

"You've never ""heard"" a single one because you probably don't listen, no offense. Most people are pretty set in their beliefs about this. I have no doubt that there are no arguments that you would consider valid or nuanced.

But the topic wasn't marriage, but competing in the Olympics. I just compared that to marriage because it is one of the most significant related social issues under contention. I don't see any point in outlining those arguments for you just to enter into a futile debate, especially since I wouldn't agree with a lot of them anyway, even if I recognize them as valid.

One thing to keep in mind, and something a lot of people overlook or ignore, is that the issue of marriage is separated into two aspects, one that involves the government recognizing marriages of various types and what that recognition entails and the other that simply involves the concept of marriage as a social construct that cannot be regulated.

Obviously the first is a debatable issue. The latter obviously is not. What I mean is that if we were talking about whether or not same-sex couples can or should be able to get married (which they can, anywhere in the country as far as I know) then I would point out that there are no valid arguments against that. It boils down to a subjective nebulous moral debate.

But if it was specified that we were talking about whether or not the government (federal, state or otherwise) can or should recognize those marriages then that is a different debate that has less to do with nebulous morality and more to do with pragmatic social considerations that are often quantifiable.

People tend to conflate both aspects of the issue into one (liberal progressives would say the former implies the latter and social conservatives would reject that, and if they were really out of touch, challenge the former, but I think that's pretty rare), but since the first isn't a concern, the second one is really the point of contention.

But like I said, that's a different issue, and this ""issue"" of gay athletes competing in the Olympics isn't even remotely similar.

"I agree that a lot of responses (mine included) are subjective, and obviously this is something close to my heart so it's way more important to me than someone who doesn't have to/hasn't gone through it.

I would of thought that you'd be against the government interfering in the market. If I'm paying for something to be done to my body I should have the choice of what is done. 

The program is essentially useless now for anyone who is not wealthy. No family with a combined income of less than 50k can come up with the 15k or so needed for one try, never mind if they need more than one try. Why would anyone do it in Quebec? I can go do it in Ontario for the same price, but at least I can choose how many embryos are put in. Or, I can go do it at a beautiful mexican resort for the same price.

"Marcus flicked away the cigarette butt, which landed a few feet away on the floor of the dimly-lit parking lot. The embers scattered and sparked, before fading away on the dark asphalt.

John offered him a light, and Marcus muttered a thanks as he pulled out another cigarette from his pack. He took a long drag and took a longer time blowing out the smoke. 

""You know,"" Marcus said, looking at the cigarette in his hand. ""I should have invested in these damn things when they made the announcement. Of course people were going back to their habits once they stopped killing you. I could have retired and be resting on a beach right now, instead of working at a 9 to 5 job till the heat death of the universe.""

""Maybe immortality wasn't all it's cracked up to be,"" John responded before taking a smoke himself. 

Marcus chuckled with a bit bitterness. ""Tell me about it.""

The two of them continued to smoke, their backs resting on the concrete walls of their apartment building. 

""Do you remember when they announced it?"" Marcus asked. ""The immortality serum, I mean.""

""Of course,"" he answered. ""Who doesn't?"" 

""And do you remember all the ruckus the religious folk spouted? 'It's against God's will!' or 'You're blocking the path to Paradise!' and all that?""

""Yeah, what about it?"" 

""We made fun of them then, but I'm feeling like they did have a point. The world was fucked as it was and we added immortality into the mix. All the wars and famines remained, but instead of a dignified end, its beginning to look like we're just prolonging everyone's misery. Maybe humans just weren't meant to be immortal. Maybe we were supposed to go on to the next world, whatever it might be. Who knows, it actually could be Paradise on the other side.""

John shrugged. ""I wouldn't worry about it too much.""

""What makes you so confident about that?""

""Because we eventually learn to do better, I suppose.""

""Not much of an answer.""

He smiled. ""No, it's not.""

""Hmph, you're a help. Now I remember why I don't talk about philosophy with you."" Marcus tapped off the ashes from his cigarette. ""Maybe we should go back inside; it's getting a bit chilly out here.""

John made a motion to get off from the wall, but stopped. ""Alright, maybe I can expand on it. According to Christianity, what was the first paradise?""

""The Garden of Eden, I suppose.""

""And that was on Earth, right? Furthermore, Adam and Eve were immortal until they committed original sin by eating the Apple. Through their own doings, they unraveled what was to be their eternal home.""

Marcus contemplated for a few moments and chuckled, this time with amusement. ""So you're saying we now have a second chance here on Earth to recreate the Garden; that there's no need for a Paradise in the afterlife. Maybe we can do better here.""

"Too many political mistakes were made with regard to this project. Hence why CATOBAR was dropped, though I can't recall if nuclear was on the cards originally. UK government fucked up here, and as a result, what could have been potentially the most capable of modern carriers has been gimped into obsolescence. 

I am a firm believer that a sophisticated carrier capability is vital to a country's defence capacity, as shown time and again by the USA, then again with their arguably 'excessive' defence budget, I would be disappointed if they didn't have full carrier coverage. In many ways they are almost as important as submarines for naval tactical capability. 

You simply can't say who is better than another in these sorts of things. In some ways Blackbird is better than many modern aircraft, but the features it had that made it better have come to be obsolete. So those features count for nothing. Size, speed and aircraft capacity isn't everything. As someone mentioned earlier training is the most important factor, quality of aircraft are only as good as the pilots flying them, and the ground team maintaining them.

It's a shame what could have been an alright thread turned into a bit of a negative environment. ",false,false,t1_cn7c7kd,Merackon,,0,1419772218,t5_2sq9y,t3_2qinvk,t3_2qinvk,2,1425183372,0,0,cn7c7kd,MilitaryPorn,2,,,

"Sorry, but I had to remove your recent post on /r/r4r because your title did not comply with our official guidelines. You can check out the guidelines [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/r4r/comments/z08ap/how_you_should_tag_your_r4r_posts/).

This is the proper way to format a title: *AGE [R4R] LOCATION - DESCRIPTION*

Here is a TL;DR checklist of what should be in your subject:

**1. Use only M, F, T, and R for tagging gender.**

**2. Use [] around the R4R tag, so it looks like [R4R]. Don't use (), {}, or anything else.**

**3. For multiple ages or letter tags, only use /'s, so it looks like 21/21 [MF4R]. Don't use . , \\ | - : ; ~ or anything else.**

**4. Your age must be included before your [R4R].**

**5. If you are posting about /r/r4r, please use a [meta] tag at the beginning of the subject.**

Please visit [the submission page](http://www.reddit.com/r/r4r/submit?sidebar&amp;title=AGE [R4R] LOCATION - TITLE) to resubmit your post. If you get an error message asking you to wait, you must wait until the timer expires before posting again.

If you're still having issues with your post, please feel free to [message the moderators](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fr4r).

Finally, please make sure you read the rules on the sidebar!

Thanks! :D

"As a start, practice SHFFLing with a wide range of characters who have very different properties: someone like Samus who has a high short hop, fast jump squat, and is very floaty; Fox, Wolf, or Falco who all fall extremely quickly; any character in-between, and any character that you have an interest in.  One bad habit I got into while perfecting my L-cancels was focusing on hand movements rather than timing.  I found myself hitting L at a certain interval after inputting the attack, even if the timing was wrong, because I had exclusively practiced SHFFLing with Falco.  I think learning with many characters helps reinforce the timing without confusing your hands and building harmul muscle memory.  Also practice whiffed SHFFLs, SHFFLs that hit an opponent, and SHFFLs that hit shields, as the timings are slightly different.

Wavedashing just takes dedicated practice, and don't be afraid to experiment with wavelands from different heights and onto platforms to establish a familiarity with the motions.  I know this gets said a lot, but once you have the techniques committed to muscle memory, you can start to think about how to apply them in the middle of a real match, and then it will all just ""click"".  

Spend some time on your own practicing fundamentals, and once you feel you have a good grip on it, PLAY ANOTHER PERSON.  There is no substitute for real match experience.  I'm home for the summer as well and am having a tough time getting matches against other players, but it is one of the most important steps in the learning process.  It'll be tough to integrate techs at first, but practice really does make perfect.  Also, set the computers to lower levels to practice fundamentals and your combo game, level 9s behave very strangely and don't give you much breathing space to work on tech, not to mention their inhuman DI.

I also strongly recommend only choosing a main in the near future.  This is a process that took me a really long time, (almost 5 months) since P:M has so many fun, unique, and balanced characters.  Develop a strong fundamental base with one character, and once you've firmly decided, delve into the more advanced character specific techniques, combos, and moveset properties.  It's sometimes misconstrued, but tech skill is defined as doing exactly what you want with your character exactly when you want to do it, within the limits of the game.  Understand these limits, specifically the limits of your character.  Choosing a secondary is a good idea in a game such as P:M, but your main should come first in practice and for match experience.

Once your fundamentals and understanding of the game are solidified, your character will feel like an extension of your hands, and it really is a great feeling.  It will also help you do much better in matches with your friends! 

Best of luck in the lab and against your friends!

"&gt;I don't think in this case it's a matter of privatization.

It most certainly is, i have to again go to the example of snow removal since they have privatized it. The government still pays for it but they have no say in the day to day operations nor who is in charge. 

Everyone in Ontario, especially north of Barrie, has noticed a major drop off in the quality of service how many ploughs are on the road, how often snow is removed etc.

But what are the options we have to rectify it? Small amounts of fines if certain criteria are not met...thats it and we are not even allowed to know what those fines are or if anyone at those companies is being disciplined for it. We cannot force them to put more ploughs on the road we have to actually pay millions more to get it. So we are paying more than when the government ran the service and getting far less for it and have far less control/transparency over who is running it.

"I created /r/Monasticism, as opposed to, for example, /r/ChristianMonasticism or /r/HinduMonasticism, in anticipation of comments like yours. Thank you for it. I am delighted by the prospect of interfaith dialogue on this subreddit.

&gt;...when you get down to the mystical core of these traditions the main tenets tend to be very similar.

Reading the *Ashtavakra Gita* some days ago, I read the following in the 'Translator's Preface' (seemingly corroborating what you say):

&gt;There are a few conventions worth mentioning. Capitalized words like
Self, Awareness, God, Absolute, Consciousness, Knowledge, Witness, That, This, Void, Light, All, One, Everything, Nothing, No-thing, Being, Me, You, It, Himself, Bliss, Supreme, Unity and Truth are used as synonyms, although sometimes in context subtle—and ultimately non-existent--differences may be intended. These words all point to What Is—the true nature of Reality.

Additionally, reading about *The Imitation of Christ* last night, I read the following:

&gt;Swami Vivekananda, the 19th Century Hindu Philosopher and founder of Vedanta Society, drew a number of parallels between the teachings of the *Imitation* and the *Bhagavad Gita*. Vivekananda wrote a preface and a translation of the *Imitation* in 1899. Vivekananda would always carry a copy of the *Bhagavad Gita* and the *Imitation*. Spiritual writer Eknath Easwaran compared the teachings of the *Imitation* with the Upanishads.",false,true,t1_cf7o52u,JayWalken,,0,1391614087,t5_303qe,t3_1x0570,t1_cf7iq6t,1,1432262903,0,0,cf7o52u,Monasticism,1,,,

"I've done a lot of research and have been doing foreskin recovery for years after I had a gland related problem but I haven't done much research lately so there may be better techniques available.

However, in the shit ton of research I did this was the most effective model to use: http://tlctugger.com/

Don't let the crappy site fool you.  The materials are high quality and the support is excellent.  The design has consistently been shown to be the most effective too by people doing personal research and it was even verbally approved by my doctor.

It takes months and years of decent commitment to really get anything restored but it works.  I have been using it for 5 years and went from having very tight uncomfortable skin to being able to completely cover the head of my penis with stretched skin.  While you're waiting for the real restoration, just wearing the cone you'll see immediate results (having your penis properly covered makes the glands healthy and more sensitive within the first day).

I'd really recommend foreskin restoration to everyone and especially to people who chafe or have dry uncomfortable glands like I did.  It really overall increases the quality of sex and general comfort.

If you're trying to make your penis bigger, I would really reconsider though.  The foreskin restoration crowd and the PE crowd have a lot of cross over and in my experience I've noticed that most PE techniques don't work and are dangerous (I've never seen good evidence of penis growth from any member using home techniques but I've seen many posts about real permanent damage people has sustained).  Many people think that stretching foreskin will also stretch your penis and make it bigger but there's little evidence to suggest this and in my experience it's not true.  The only effective thing to make your penis longer is surgery and that has some nasty side effects.  There is a safe surgery to make your penis wider though which involves injecting fat into it I believe but that is wildly expensive.

If you want my honest opinion, try to be happy with the length of your penis because there really isn't much you can do and it honestly does not matter.  If you have a partner who cares about that sort of thing then they're the wrong partner.

However, if you want better sex and comfortable foreskin, I would definitively recommend foreskin restoration as that is very real and effective.",false,true,t1_cey0737,[deleted],,0,1390596355,t5_2qh13,t3_1w0z4l,t1_cexypdt,1,1435518907,0,0,cey0737,worldnews,1,,,

"It's sad that your friends don't enjoy the game as much as you do. Personally I couldn't stop playing from the moment I logged into the beta weekend, that's how much I enjoyed GW2. I'm not sure that I agree with your idea that people who remember the 'glory days' of WoW won't get hooked on GW2. I played WoW for years since vanilla and have very fond memories of it. That didn't stop me from playing GW2 for nearly 2 years straight, because GW2 is an amazing game. I took a break a few months back to play Mists of Pandaria, finished most of the things I wanted to achieve raiding, achievement and pvp-wise, then unsubbed and am waiting for WoD to be released.

 I still play GW2 because it's free, that's the bottom line. I've always enjoyed the gameplay, the mechanics, the combat, the graphics, the story, everything. I can come back and play it whenever I want, however much I want, and still enjoy it. The reason most of my friends have stopped playing, and the reason I take breaks from time to time is simply because of the lack of permanent content added to the game and the fact that I feel like I don't have much to do these days apart from some casual WvW, PvP and dungeons when I feel like it. It has nothing to do with the fact that I've played other games previously. I guess people either like the gameplay or they don't. Like Colin said in his post the other day, people who are used to MMOs will probably pick up GW2 pretty quickly, it's people for whom this is the first MMO they've ever played that are the focus of upcoming features. I personally think they will simply over-complicate existing and fairly simple systems (i.e. downed state) and make leveling feel more clunky (gated personal story level restrictions), but that's clearly the market they are now aiming at, so I guess we'll have to see if it works for them.",false,true,t1_ck4q5gw,Towering_Pile_Of_Ham,,0,1409417732,t5_2r9po,t3_2f0akk,t3_2f0akk,1,1427281999,0,0,ck4q5gw,Guildwars2,1,,,

"even if you end up with another pair of tmg's that deal more damage, the gulds will always have a place due to their potential. the ability to pull them out and heal yourself without having to rely on a finite amount of mates has TONS of utility. i believe they dropped in both td quests (i got both of mine from td1, but i believe they dropped in td2 as well). with a new td eq coming soon, you might be able to find a pair in there. the odds of getting them from td felt much higher than the odds of falz dropping one.

"Why do you get downvoted?  Because you bitch about the card endlessly instead of acknowledging the literally dozens of ways to play around it or counter it outright.  Is it powerful?  Absolutely.  But it is not the overwhelming game-breaking card you make it out to be.

The following are all MONO-COLOR ways of handling FGC.  Orange doesn't have any, but also pairs EXTREMELY well with some of these solutions.  Pretty much all of these solutions can be optimized further with the right off color.

----
Blue 

* Goosebump Giver

Frighten FGC.  Your opponent loses ground.  This requires another source of fear, but they're not hard to find, and Blue gets Thunderclap.

* Chief Thunderhooves

If the opponent wants to use her power, frighten it.  Your opponent loses ground.

* Cloudchaser

One Cloudchaser counters one FGC quite solidly.

* Foal Free Press

If you haven't yet messed around with this card, you haven't seen real AT abuse yet.

* Two Bits

Not the greatest answer, but can be used to push any of the above out except FFP.

* Lead Pony Badge

Can be used to double up on Cloudchasers, something FGC cannot do.

* Winged Wonder, Holly Dash, Wild Fire, Fears Must Be FAced, Gotta Go Fast, Swift

Who even needs AT when playing Blue?

----
Pink

* Ear to Ear

While a card isn't equal to 1 AT, it helps you find any of the other responses here, and Pink's responses tend toward being very solid.

* Pinkie ""Responsibility"" Pie

Expensive to deploy, but can be used without any warning.

* Cheese Sandwich

A ridiculously powerful counter to FGC.  Not only does he counter FGC, but nearly every other AT abusing friend as well.  And you only have to draw one, because he goes back to the hand.

* Downright Dangerous + Here's Your Invitation

Inefficient, but workable

* Rock, PAper, Scissors, Shoot!

A straightforward counter that doesn't even cost AT.

* Too Much Fun

FGCs are often with a forest owl.  Not ideal due to cost, but workable in the right scenario.

* Chicken Costume

1 AT.  YOur opponent can still get one more AT drain from you, if they really want to, but it's cheap and the requirement is easy to meet, especially with a Pink mane.

----
Purple

* Studious Friend + Magic Duel

Exhausted FGCs become 2 AT

* All-Team Organizer

Counters FGC in equal numbers, but is easier to play.

----
White

* Inspired

White can force the opponent to burn AT drawing just to GET an FGC in the first place.

* RTO

While not exactly a counter to FGC, RTO is a far bigger issue than FGC ever has been.

* Picture Perfect Pony + Fashion Week

FGC can't even be recurred after this is done with.

----
Yellow

* FGC

Obviously, FGC is a good answer to itself.

* Staring Contest

Costs you nothing, costs them 3 AT to replay it.

* Nurse Redheart (+ Eep! for more consistency)

If you have any way to reliably pump her, FGC instantly becomes worthless.

* Critter Stampede

Not ideal, but still technically nets you some gain.

----
Troublemakers

* Purple Parasprite

Requires double and that it be played early, but counters a T2 FGC with 2 AT and puts your opponent in a tight spot.

* Princess Mi Amore Cadenza

Expensive, but can run in any deck.  Your opponent using it only balances the AT loss.

* Sunset Shimmer

Not permanent, but if your opponent wants the FGC back, it'll cost just as much as you spent, and you are given temporary relief.  And can run in any deck.

"That was Sinclairs selling point - Mass produced microcomputers at a fraction of the cost of the competition.

Adjusting for inflation, The ZX at launch cost about £450. Compare that to C64 at £500 or the BBC Micro which was £600 for the cheapest model. The NES launched at about £650-£700, and the cartridge based games were an order of magnitude more expensive than tapes.

Unlike the US which was enjoying an economic boom in the 80s, things in the UK were a lot more grim with a 124% rise in unemployment. Cheaper products fared better, and games consoles struggled to make a mark.

You can see Sinclairs cost-saving method right through their microcomputer line.

"I'm always a little annoyed when people are so startled that something in a religious text is proven to have possibly existed. 

There are cities in the bible that existed then and still do today.  There are locations and geographical features documented in the bible and backed up by archeology and/or secular written history. 

The bible was written within a historical context - not some fictional Tolkien fantasy world.  People will write about people and places they know.  These stories are passed along and change and grow with retellings and translations.  But at the core, there are people and places that existed.  

Its like King Arthur.  Did he have a magician as a mentor and a magical sword from the Lady of the Lake? No.  Was there a warlord or local leader who was pretty successful and united a few tribes for a few generations? Maybe had an Ulfberht sword that would have seemed pretty magical.

"The nerf only hits the heroes that were particularly ""OP"" when it comes to split pushing.  The concept is and should be alive and well and it will never go away as long as any hero can do any substantial damage to buildings at any point.  

I think people that call heroes ""split push heroes"" maybe miss the fact that it is a concept independent of any heroes.  The concept is based on the simple fact that you can't be in 2 places at once.  It is about effective trading and efficiency.  Terrorblade was literally absurd when he was able to to solo push while his team bought him a little time.  This nerf is definitely aimed at him in particular, but its not going to crush the concept by any means.  Split pushing coming about was an evolutionary period for dota.

"Completely disagree with the majority of this post. The new player experience for most new players currently is: spawn in, run out of spawn room, get farmed by BR100s, uninstall the game. They don't even get to see these big Planetside moments you talk about. Putting them up against people of more equal skill is a much better way of allowing them to learn the mechanics and understand the game without just getting relentlessly farmed. You also seem to overestimate how long it takes to get to BR10, it really doesn't take a long time, so you aren't going to see players who think they were good just because of doing well on the new player island (especially if SOE communicate this well). People using alts can be fairly easily countered by only allowing access on first characters and if the occasional person decides to farm with a new account, so what? This is exactly what is happening on live right now just with much greater frequency not to mention on the new player island they can only do it for a very short period of time due to the BR10 cut off. The problem with AA for new players is a general problem with the game and not specific to this Island in any way, SOE could fix this by just giving new players the Grounder (and NC/VS equivalents) like they did with the Shotguns.

"Mind that this is purely anecdotal and I don't have statistics to back this up or anything, but in my experience, most of the people I know with English ancestry are so mixed up with various other types of European (since the largest bulk of immigration from England happened so far back in the US' history) that they aren't really able to identify as specifically ""English""-American in any meaningful way. It's not like they're rejecting their English culture for not being exotic enough or anything (us Americans tend to LOVE the English, lol) it's more that they're probably 3/8 English, 1/16 Scottish, 1/4 German, 1/7 French et. al.

"most Urgots I see go adc * facpalm *, then feed with an average of 3/8/4ish * double facepalm *.

The others build tank and go 0/15/2.

If played right, Urgot is a tank shredder and a duelist. His point is to take out the tank. People ridicule you for focusing the Leona in the teamfights even though you can kill her with a ewqqq. 

People are always like ""why didn't you get the adc? GG report!"", when Urgot will most often take way too much damage from the adc without putting out enough. 

You have your mid laner for that. Without their tank, they can not engage easily. Everyone underestimates that, and there is no real meta pick for it and it isn't seen as a role. But it is.

With the frozen heart, you can make fair trades in lane. This isn't to make you the tank that can't attack and can't die. 

The bork is more helpful in lane for sustain, and against tanks then the bloodthirster.

The two armor pen items lets you do true damage to the one you are countering. He doesn't need to duel the others as much as the tank.

Your manamune is just general damage for cheap cost.

Sitting there as a tank is useless because Urgot's kit doesn't synergize with tank builds. There are much better champs for that. 

Focusing on general kills will just end up with a dead Urgot that is too slow to run away or keep up because he gets bursted down so quick without putting up a fight.

This is why Urgot has a very special place where not many others exist.

oh and i spent most of today getting spots out of the couch cushion.

i still have goosebumps from how cold i was. my mind is racing. i dont remember parts of last night. i cant find my headphones and lost all my contacts on my phone.

I certainly don't frown on proxies. Since my friends don't have their own sets yet (they are still feeling the game out), I allow them to proxy cards since they tend to get pissed if someone uses their influence to take cards that they intended to use in their deck.

At the moment, I've revised the list a bit. Dropped the diesels for 3x inside job. Dropped the stim hack for a 3rd deja vu. Dropped the nerve agent for keyhole.

"Up until WWI (kinda, more realistically WWII) the rape of the women by the invading army was considered the standard practice.  From Mongolians to Frenchmen, when are army took over a land the soldiers would be encouraged (or at least allowed) to rape at their leisure.

When Germany invaded Belgium during WWI (in what is now known as the ""Rape of Belgium"") the German soldiers were permitted, even encouraged, to rape the Belgian women.  

This was actually the turning point in wartime rape.  It was a huge PR folly for the German army, as the stories of the rapes went world wide and were used to rally support against the German government.  Before this point it was actually business-as-usual for an invading army to rape women en masse.

Mass media, and the dissemination of information, was what turned the tide against this tactic.  Pre-WWI rape was considered a ""good tactic"" because it would keep the invaded peoples demoralized and depressed.  Support our troops by giving them supplies or be forced to watch as they rape your daughter and wife.  Resist and die.  It was a way to control, demoralize, and force into submission the peoples you had conquered.

But that was before TV, Radio, and the rapid spread of information.  People in America, Russia, and the UK couldn't be horrified at something they didn't know was happening or only heard vague rumors about months later.  But now that the truth of this type of war tactic was exposed, the sensible people couldn't stand for it and would demand action.

Wartime rape still occurs, but it is no longer a tactic used to suppress populations in the western world.  Like collective punishment, mass media exposure has caused it to fall by the wayside.  Generals no longer encourage it, and it is (usually) punished when caught.

But don't kid yourself.  Genghis Khan's army raped, Alexander the Great's army raped, the Holy Roman Army raped, Napoleon's Army raped... all of them.  They all did it.  Mention a major war up to 100 years ago, and it's extremely likely the invading army raped the women of the people they invaded en masse.  

It's the sick, disgusting truth of war. ",false,true,t1_cfdthm6,Hyperdrunk,,0,1392244569,t5_2qh13,t3_1xpj7v,t1_cfdrley,183,1432371138,0,0,cfdthm6,worldnews,183,,,

"I have violent thoughts all the damn time, probably due to the way I never deal with my negative emotions in a healthy way, and was a very morbid child who became obsessed with bones at a young age. After reading about Jeffrey Dahmer's [early life](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeffrey_Dahmer#Early_life) (the way he enjoyed the sound of bones, the fact that his dad thought he was just teaching his son a scientific hobby, etc.) and thinking about how fucking weird I am (awkward/painfully shy with social anxiety and a continuing love of bones), I often wonder if I would have turned out like him had my childhood been different, or if something might set me off and I'll just snap one day. 

Sometimes I question whether or not my mom should have encouraged my bone collecting and obsessing over mummification too. I don't know if she was as oblivious as his dad or if she just figured I was a girl who never purposely hurt any living thing in her life or wet the bed and obviously wasn't sociopathic so there was nothing to worry about.

"A few things come to my mind:

1. Way to many currencies. I hate that MMO's require you to have a separate forms of currency for every little thing. And over time that just goes up. I would much rather a single gold system, and something in place where players can lose a portion of their fortune, whether through PvP or failed dungeons. 

2. Stat systems. Everything is exceedingly dumbed down. I am ok for a few imbalances, but I'd like to see more freedom in terms of stats and gear. 

3. Community. Everything is so sectioned off now. Back in Lotro someone suggested a reverly buff system. You gain the buff by hanging out in the Prancing Pony playing, music, drinking, sharing food, playing games, and just in general socialising.

"Throughout my university career I planned every assignment and all my revision around doing it at the last minute. I worked out my theoretical maximum speed for completing work or consolidating knowledge to my best ability and planned my start date around that. In doing this I had no choice when I started any given task to focus my entire attention to it. 

I spent a good portion of my time enjoying myself and not concerning myself with looming deadlines whilst many of my friends stressed for small periods of time every day whilst they studied. I was in fact made to feel guilty about this technique, particularly around exam period as I would begin revision only days rather than weeks before the exam date and still perform well. 

I learnt fairly quickly that this technique was effective provided that I also planned for mistakes and problems in my assignments. This is crucial. Nobody is perfect, and no plan is perfect. Another aspect I found important to this technique was the working environment I was in. Although I accept this is different for everyone (particularly students), for me to truly work to my best I had to place myself in an environment where my only option was to work such as a library or locked bedroom.

I do however stand by this technique but it requires you to have a very good understanding of your own abilities and the discipline to apply yourself fully when the time comes.

"&gt;We want to be crawling all over their borders.

This is an idea that will only invite disaster. 

&gt;Russia is bullying its neighbors into joining their Eurasian Union, and threatening destabilization on the periphery of the Europe Union. Russia is again attempting to create an alternative system to the liberal international order, and this time it's a much more conservative and cynical vision.

This is one interpretation of Russian intentions. I think it would be wise to pay attention to the Russian interpretation as well. By swallowing up the nations on its borders, we are forcing Russia to react. This is the epitome of foolishness. The West says we are bringing those nations into our fold to protect them from Russia. Russia sees things very differently. We shouldn't needlessly antagonize Russia over some seemingly insignificant nations. 

&gt;With each additional NATO member the West draws a line in the sand that Russia does not dare cross. Who cares if they don't like it? They can either play ball in accordance with the international system they're now part of, or face isolation and economic ruin like the Soviet Union.

"Yeah. I don't like how they're all clones of the same dude (even if it is a Fett) I always hoped the cloning thing was so the best and most elite fighters could fight and die over and over.

One of my favorite fan-theories (completely destroyed by the prequels) was that when in ANH old Ben says: ""I fought with your father in the clone wars."" ... it was Ben and Anakin that were the clones fighting other clones. The idea being that both sides broke some moral code and made clones. This Ben was just one of many Ben-clones and that was just one Anakin of many. Maybe one time Ben trained Anakin, another time an Anakin trained a Ben. That was how Vader could kill Luke's father and still be his father at the same time. I worked this all out a few hours after seeing Empire.

I know, I know, it's all impossible with the prequels and the extended universe and blah blah. Okay. The idea of Obi Wan and Anakin playing out their master-student relationship over and over, dying over and over, and finally one Ben escapes the cycle felt very Blade-Runner.

"Your fellow Germans should be insulted by your stupidity.

&gt;Ah, you aren't familiar with the Rhineland occupation, I wager?

&gt;The Versailles Treaty also stipulated that the Allied military forces would withdraw from the Rhineland in 1935, although they actually withdrew in 1930.

&gt;The remilitarization of the Rhineland by the German Army took place on 7 March 1936 when German military forces entered the Rhineland.

Oh look, because the British withdrew too early, the Germans immediately began to retake the land militarily. Looks like it was a huge mistake to me for anyone to have given that land back to the Germans. So my point is in fact strengthened by your mentioning of the Rhineland. Thank you for bringing that up.

"&gt;&gt; It's the alarmists who have been making overconfident claims of attribution.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; There are no such ""overconfident claims"", that's just more BS from the usual science deniers.
&gt; 

Here's a pertinent one from the IPCC for you:

""It is extremely likely that more than half of the observed increase in global average surface temperature from 1951 to 2010 was caused by the anthropogenic increase in greenhouse gas concentrations and other anthropogenic forcings together. The best estimate of the human induced contribution to warming is similar to the observed warming over this period.""

&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt;&gt; As it turns out, nature doesn't care about the ""consensus"" and their thoroughly useless actively harmful models.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Actually, climate models have been mostly right in their predictions with regards to the multi-decadal warming trend. 

With regard to temperature trends - the older models forecast accelerated warming, which has not happened, and the newer models have not been tested with decades of data.

&gt;Deniers have been cherry-picking shorter time frames to push their propaganda, but there is little scientific merit to their claims.

Very good. 

What timeframe do you have in mind when asserting that climate models are ""mostly good"" for average temperture?

"I play primarily live cash games and I've had similar spells with my longest lasting 6 weeks. I've come to the conclusion that it comes from a combination of being tight and the low rate of hands/hour that comes with live games. I've timed it several times and it's not unusual to only see only 10-15 hands/hour. After sitting mostly idle for 4 hours, it seems as if I've seen hundreds of hands and am being screwed personally by God. The reality is that I've only seen around 60-80 hands, which isn't a significant sample. If a streak has lasted a few sessions, I'll drive the extra distance to a casino where I know they get a lot of hands out. (I live in the eastern PA area and have a few choices.)  

One thing that absolutely doesn't work for me is getting frustrated, saying ""screw it,"" and playing all the crap that typical loose passive cash game players play. That just gets me into the same problems that they always get into; bottom two getting counterfeited, A-rag kicker issues, idiot ending straights, hitting a lower flush, etc. Instead, I try to use the ""dead"" time productively by working on hand reading, tell reading, or counting drills.

"When you're dating, I think it's a safe assumption that the people that you are meeting are talking to or even sleeping with other people, unless they pointedly state otherwise. However, when you start crossing into ""L word"" territory, that's when the topic of exclusivity should and has come up for you. For most people, love = exclusivity. For non-monogamous people, love = I love you exclusively, but I am sleeping with other people too. Poly people can love more than one person. Sometimes those interchange (NM relationships can turn emotional, unless there are agreements that they can't) but that's the general gist. 

If she was seeing this guy before you, you're the new guy, despite the emotional closeness. It's easy to see why this is making you insecure. If you want to keep it nonmonogamous, ask her if she's ready for an emotional commitment to you, which would mean she's just having sex with the other guy. If they are already emotionally involved, you're already in a polygamous relationship and need to work within that framework communication-wise. 

The key thing is to talk. It sounds like you guys already communicate well, so hash out your feelings with her. Show her this post as a starting point for the conversation - it will probably be easier than trying to verbalize your emotions. 

Read some of the books on the sidebar, I'm more of a fan of ""Opening Up"" than I am of ""The Ethical Slut"" but any one of the books will help you with jealousy issues. The more you talk and work out the parameters of the relationship, the less jealous you'll be. Once you realize that jealousy is more of a manifestation of possessiveness than it is of love you'll go a long way towards conquering it. 

Congratulations on finding such a great relationship. You sound like a really decent guy if you're willing to emotionally invest yourself without any reservation - too many people are walking around with huge walls around themselves, even in the NM/Poly world. It's not every day that you find love, but it sounds like you guys can really make it work.

"Well, one of my favorite things to do, and something that is GREAT for money, renown, and love from your lord is to become a vassal of the Papal states. The papal states themselves never go to war, but if you go to the Pope, you can ask to go fight in the crusades. This is where the real fun begins. You are now temporarily the vassal of the Crusader States, a client state of the Papal states. Now, you have to sail all the way across the ocean(It takes forever) and you should end up in Tyre, Acre, or the other two cities. Before you leave, though, make sure you hire all of your lances from your village, if you get less than 5, sucks for you. Once you get into Acre, first thing you do is buy at least two mercenary korps. They are excellent, and I prefer the Muslim one's myself. Be warned, if you are a Catholic leader, and most of your soldiers are catholic, and you hire Islamic troops, you will take the biggest morale drop you have ever seen. It sucks because the Muslim troops are arguably the best mercenaries in the game, so if you do it, you better be raiding around the clock, gotta pay these hoes. After a year or so of fighting the Muslims, if you haven't take Jerusalem, at the very least you should have about 10,000 or 20,000 denars.

&gt; i play several bit coin penny stocks. trade the channels and am accumulating free stock for the long haul. as penny stocks easy to get had so protect profits and holding free stock is way to go! currently in BYSD always an easy weekly flip and they actually sell bit coins in cold storage(offline) as a means for security! pretty ingenious

"I think that a lot of artists do what your saying, and it helps make them more marketable because they become a little ""larger then life"" by doing so. I really think Daft Punk, Nero, and UZ are some of the best examples. Since they aren't a ""real person"" in any sense, it's almost like they achieve a movie or book character level of existence. It also helps them go to the grocery store without signing autographs. 

Now, on the flip side of things many artists like Borgore, Diplo, Flosstradamus, they all post funny pics, selfies, they repost fan's art and photoshoped pictures of the artist, they do normal statuses that a regular person would too. This makes them more accessible to their audience and makes people feel like if they ever ran into them, they could have a beer together, smoke a j, and whatever. 

My point is both can work but your really talking about opposite ends of the spectrum here. One is distancing themselves with their theatrics and the other is appealing to people's love of social media and that role in their life. You can play a middle ground where you do some cool theatrics on stage, but remain a normal dude on your fb, twitter, out and about. I personally think that's the best way to do it. 

And to the people raging on this question, chill out, there's no harm in starting the groundwork of this kind of stuff when you start out because then it'll evolve with your music and live performances rather then being forced once people pay attention to you.

Sure people with money speak louder, but this aint the government, this is the consumer demanding the company who claims to be revolutionizing the auto industry make a product the for the mass market already.  Otherwise, I'll continue to praise Tesla for what they're doing, but in the mean time, my money is still going to Toyota for a usable car.

Tesla's shouldn't be an 'aspirational' product if they want to take over the market.  Eventually they have to make the utility car if they want any kind of revolution.

"Mary was sitting silently in the passenger seat. It was a long drive, and usually she would pass the time by talking to Jack but not tonight. He was talking away as usual, about the fish he'll catch, dinner with the neighbours tomorrow, which trail they should walk the day after. But he wasn't talking to Mary, he was talking at her. She let the words wash over her, listening to the ebb and flow of his tone, but not really absorbing anything.

She didn't mind. She hated making this drive, it took too long and it was badly lit. Why hadn't they bought a cabin closer to home? 

By the time they reached the long, unpaved drive to the cabin, Jack had fallen silent too. The car pulled up to the front door, and the automatic floodlights came on.

""You go inside and get settled,"" Jack said. ""I'll bring the bags."" She give him a small, crooked smile and nodded, before getting out of the car.

The key was in the usual place, under a plant pot and the lights in the hall turned on as she opened the door. The house was quiet, she couldn't even hear the refrigerator.

The tv is on.

Muted, but the flickering blue light catches her attention. She walks over to the tv, skirting around the coffee table, wondering how long it's been left on. She's slightly annoyed at Jack, he probably left it on before they rushed out last time, and now they'll get a huge power bill.

The news is on, and the banner down the bottom of the screen catches her eye. ""MAINE COUPLE IN FATAL SMASH,"" it blares at her. The newscaster, pretty and blonde and young, is replaced with a twisted mess of steel.

Mary grimaces, she hates how the news seems to revel in the tragedy of others. Disaster porn. Anything to get the ratings up.

Her hand is on the remote to turn it off when the camera zooms in on the car. It's the same model car she has, as far as she can tell. The midsection of the car is nothing more than a chrome nightmare, but the boot is mostly intact. It looks like the semi in the background hit the front drivers side of the car.

Mary can feel the hair on her arms stiffening, and she shivers. Silly, she's being silly she thinks to herself, as she sits down on the couch.
Her hand is still on the remote, but she hasn't turned it off. Instead, she turns the volume on.

""... unconfirmed cause as of yet, according to police, however we can report that there are two fatalities, both travelling in the northbound car on State Highway 45. The driver of the other vehicle is currently in a serious, but stabl-"".

Mary mutes it again. While the on scene reporter has been talking, the camera has zoomed in on the wreckage. The boot of the car has popped open and Mary can clearly see the Louis Vuitton suitcase in there. It's very similar to the one Jack bought her for Christmas two years ago.

Mary took a deep, shuddering breath and turned off the TV. What a terrible way to go, she thought.

She stood up, and made her way back to the front door. Jack was taking too long and she should help him with the bags. 
The house felt cold, and Mary realized that the front door was still wide open. How long had she been watching the news? Jack must be having trouble with her bag, and he'll be fuming by now.

The car wasn't in the drive. Exasperated, Mary went to the garage, ignoring the gnawing feeling in her stomach. Of course the car was in the garage, Jack wouldn't want to leave it outside overnight.
Even with the door closed Mary could see the internal garage light wasn't on, and Jack wasn't in there. She stood there with her hand resting on the door handle, waiting for one last moment. She didn't want to open the door to an empty garage.

""Mary,"" he said, right behind her. ""Mary, are you sleeping?""

She opened her eyes, and she was still in the car and they were still driving. Of course. Of course they were driving, they were still half an hour away.

""Sorry I woke you,"" Jack said, snatching brief glances at her as he drove. ""You were making some awful strange noises. Bad dream?""
She made a non-committal noise and shrugged. There were no lights on this stretch of road, but she could see headlights in the distance.
They grew closer and Jack continued to talk. He wondered if any of the port was left from last time. There should be one bottle still unopened, he mused. Or had they finished that at the New Years party?

The lights were moving quickly towards them, and Mary felt her throat constricting. Stupid, that a dream could have this much of an effect at her. 

Jack squeezed her hand, and gave her a smile. ""Are you sure you're okay?"" He asked. Mary saw the truck now, it was close, very close, too close and her heart was hammering. Jack turned his head towards it, too late he spun the steering wheel as the truck came closer, closer.

"It is easy to make grand statements about what regulation should fix, but it is much harder to actually implement those regulations.  Those regulations can also cause unforeseen circumstances.

"Hi, i'm playing Strife since 2 weeks so i think it's a good time for my first feedback. 

1. Champion balance in game:
Personaly i think that most champions are pretty much balanced, but there are 3 champions that step on higher tier. Rook, Minevra and Bastion. If you want more from me why i think so, let me know, i would make a bigger text about that.

2. Reward system.
It's totatly stupid for me, all is based on luck. This is most annoying and frustrating thing in game. Today i won matches in a row and 1 lost, and i get 2/2/2/2/1/1/2 chests. Is this fair? If you wanna keep it like this, at least make it that after won game i'll pick up from 5-10 chests. And if i lose a game, 1-5.

3. Pretty much agree with all what Pufa_Pufa wrote.

4. Pls, make a new huge giveaway, player base is so smal in this game that sometime we need to wait 20 min for a game...

EDIT! Some new things i need to write:

5. Is there any option in the game to check how much exp i need to reach next lvl? For ex how much exp left to get lvl 6? Which is very important information in moba.

"Being able to point to previous work is helpful, and publicizing the previous work you've done can help bring in leads.

Kaggle can give you a framework for doing work that supports those goals, but it is rarely the optimal way to pursue those goals unless the lack of a guiding framework is a critical obstacle for you.

Do Kaggle if it's fun, and feel free to point to work done in connection with Kaggle. But don't feel obligated to do Kaggle just as a job hunt checkbox.

Job hunting strategy:

* Find the overlap between ""companies you want to work for"" and ""companies which will benefit from hiring you.""
* Pitch those companies on how you can help them, using prior data to support your predicted outcome.

Job ads are a decent signal of where a company is currently feeling a lack of skills or man-hours. They're a poor signal of whether a company will be interested in hiring you. If you're focusing your job search exclusively on job ads, you're gonna have a bad time. Particularly if those ads are coming strictly from job search sites.

This will work against our efforts. Because almost nobody knows about DMT, almost nobody will care about its legalization.

"I have a PPK/S and it is a very nice and reliable pistol (especially since it is a S&amp;amp;W mfg). However, I see some problems with it for HD. First, is that it is small. This can make holding the pistol more difficult, especially under recoil. The small size also does you a disservice in a HD scenario due to the greatly reduced sight radius when compared to a full size pistol. Speaking of sights, that is the next problem. If I'm not mistaken, the sights are fixed to the slide and cannot be easily replaced with night sights (if anyone makes them for it). The low capacity is an issue, especially when bundled with the others issues listed above. Finally, the last issue I have is there is no way to attach a flashlight to the pistol. I always have a light on my HD firearms because I want to absolutely sure who I would be about to shoot.

Availability (details, do not just say ""always"" or on the lines of that):


Throughout the whole summer I will be available.


Tell us about yourself (details):


About my self in life? :


I was Born in South Korea, and immigrated to Canada at a young age. I played hockey and was nearly 2 months away from getting drafted to the WHL, before my parents thought my grades weren't good enough. Started playing League and pretty much was my escape through the tiny depression I had from missing hockey.

League : 


I started playing League after I quit hockey. I've been playing for a year and a half now and i enjoy it very much. I'm at a fairly young age, and going pro could be a chance for me.


Experience in competitive League of Legends(details):


The closest to competitive I've ever had, was a D1 team wanting to get in to the coke league, We were in promotions for challenger, and I was kicked unfortunately due to problems with me and the leader. I had lots of fun with that team. I was the ADC for them, but I don't play that role 


anymore due to not being able to carry as hard in soloq.


Longest duration with a Ranked 5s Team:


7 months. With the team that I was talking about above.


For how long are you willing to commit to this project/team?:

100% As long as we can go.

Experience outside of League of Legends(details):

I played hockey AAA. Was an MVP in the league 2 times in a row, leading scorer, leading points.



Why you should be considered (details):

I can gave a huge impact on shotcalling from the mid position, I can see the game very well and make good decisions, and i'm a pretty chill guy who could get a long with the teammates very well. I don't get offended from criticism and take them very well.

"You're welcome!

It would play more like an online persistent universe Skyrim I suppose but I can say with complete honesty that in terms of recent games, there is no comparable... which is a big part of why this project is so cool.

This will be a PC-only game with fantastic graphics (which, like everything, are still a work in progress but pretty awesome already), epic singleplayer storyline in a military-type 50-100 hour campaign, huge 100+ system open persistent online universe with more than a million players worldwide all together in the same massive single server.

Trading, racing, mining (metals and fuels), refining, piracy and boarding, bounty hunting, mercenary work, exploration (charting, mapping, finding new star systems to expand the game universe, and some planetary exploration), salvage, information running, multicrew and capital ship gameplay, organizational warfare, FPS gameplay and much more stuff.

In particular the trading and economic model is very intricate and interesting.  The economy will be fully simulated with player actions directly impacting the functioning of the economy.  Goods in the 'Verse are actually produced which means that actions that disrupt the flow of raw materials and supplies are reflected in the functioning of economic nodes (factories) and the price/availability of goods.  The economy will also generate many missions for players - if a factory needs a raw material the economy will automatically create a mission for players to bring that raw material in, or if supplies of a raw material are being interrupted by pirate attacks the economy may create bounty or escort missions to kill the pirates and re-open the supply lines.

Ships have to actually be built so if you have a rare or huge ship that isn't produced constantly, there is significant risk to losing it as you may need to wait until a new one is produced before getting the replacement from your insurance.

You will be charged a lot of small fees in the game which reflect the real world.  Taxes, levies, tariffs, fees, hangar rental fees, landing fees, insurance costs, fuel costs, etc.

There is at least one ship dedicated to fuel mining (the Starfarer).  Hydrogen fuel will be ""mined"" from gas giants by these beasts and hauled to space stations for refining.  The Starfarer can be modified to do some on-board refining as well.  It can also be used as a refuelling ship.

I could go on for freaking days about this game but I hope you understand how excited we all are about this project.  If you have any questions at all, I'm happy to help. :)

It has such massive scope, which is why the $52 million in crowdfunding.

There are over 270 developers working on this game in over 9 studios, and at least 4 countries.

"well it wasnt *at* the gym but  it can happen at a gym, i had benched/lifted for 10+ years with NO injuries then this happened... i was benching my max and seriously injured my shoulder, I struggled on the last few reps and when i couldnt lift it i looked to my spotter who was completely OBLIVIOUS WATCHING TV, i couldnt make enough noise to get any attention from said person and tried to adrenaline it up back onto the bar,  my left  shoulder popped (partial dislocation or a ligament tear i think i never was seen by a doctor) the barbell fell on my eye and missed the eyeball by like a 1/4 inch, i had a golf ball sized lump on the bone around the eye socket and the whole eye area turned black and swelled shut for about a week. the eye injury was the least of my problems i wish it had only been that.

 the shoulder joint never healed correctly and i cant benchpress anymore :( which makes me really really sad because i LOVE benchpressing. it took several weeks to get functional use out it again and its still limited, i can do pushups (sorry excuses for pectoral growth compared to benchpressing) and i can do curls (which oddly makes it hurt less throughout the day) but certain ranges of motion are not an option for me, i can no longer sleep on my left side, ever. which is the only way i used to sleep n i never rest as well now. it hurts everyday, tolerable, but a constant reminder, it gets worst when i sit on a chair or sofa without an armrest. i cant even play xbox in peace anymore because the way the shoulder sits holding a controller sets it off. 

 advice if your using a traditional benchpress: MAKE SURE YOUR SPOTTER HAS HIS ARMS UNDER THE BAR AND PAYS YOU CONSTANT UNDIVIDED ATTENTION. if you are the spotter PAY ATTENTION, BE READY, THATS WHAT SPOTTING *IS* . and remember that even if you have benched for a decade you can still get hurt. permanently hurt.

"""expect massive price fixing and insider trading""

--  Can you explain what you're envisioning by this?

I ask, as my view... is that if Bitcoin continues to grow in acceptance, then it's a simple matter of demand and supply. Fixed supply (can't just print bitcoins out of thin air) and increasing demand, will mean that price WILL continue to increase. Due to this, it would seem that creation of ETFs and the ability to play financial tricks (naked short-selling, etc.) would have limited impact on Bitcoin. Price could not be suppressed artificially, if demand continued to increase (if an increasingly higher number of consumers wanted to use Bitcoins to pay for goods and services).",false,true,t1_ci7p1xa,eragmus,,0,1402787331,t5_2s3qj,t3_285qzk,t1_ci7nzef,9,1434241423,0,0,ci7p1xa,Bitcoin,9,,,

"Lag ""disturbs"" more than just the Brazilian people with the higher ping. If you have a higher ping, your character does not appear to lower ping players where you truly are, which means although you're pumping in who the hell knows how many bullets into a person, only a fraction of them are hitting where you want them to. The reverse is also true, lower ping people are properly represented to both players where they truly are, and are therefore easier targets for when these Brazilian people take their shots. I cannot even begin to tell you how many times I've seen bullets go right through the heads of players with high pings, only for them to decimate the other person in a split second, once the ""game has caught up.""

Also, what exactly is the problem with IP banning? Many games I've come across that have localizations across the globe, like ZMR, IP ban those that are not within their region to keep players within their own respective localizations. The only exception I've seen is when a localization is branded as ""Global,"" then the IP bans are either lax or nonexistent. ZMR has localizations in China, Europe, North America, and who would have guessed, Brazil.

"Something that has really helped me recently is to not think of failures in a negative way.  Rethink them into ""experiences"" instead.  All failures are experiences where we learn, grow, and change.  Use each one as a lesson to move forward, not to look backward and relive those awful feelings.  All that is doing is keeping you from moving ahead and (excuse me for a moment because this will sound really fluffy) unlock your true potential.  Ultimately, you have to make that choice, but in having that choice, you have the power to shape your life into what you want it to be.

If it feels overwhelming, focus on setting mini-goals.  I know a lot of ladies on here are signed up for the 100-day challenge.  You may even try a 30-day challenge to start.  Or join the 6-week challenge that's starting up in September (what great timing!) - this will help to keep you accountable.  Once you reach one goal, set another, then another, then another, keep striving for bigger and better until you find your stride.  Once you're there, it'll be like auto-pilot.

"&gt;At the time of the crash Palmer – a night time delivery driver for Frys Logistics Ltd in Launceston – had little sleep because instead of resting during the day he was working on vehicle maintenance for the firm.

Did no one else notice this bit?

I suspected that tired career drivers normally have a reason for why they became so tired. It could be just that they stayed up late at the pub, but in this case it seems like he was being way over-worked by his firm.

Considering the state of the labour market, I wouldn't expect he has much choice in the matter if he wants to keep his job. So why is all our ire and punishments directed at him, and none at the firm that over-worked him to the point that he killed two cyclists?

Perhaps this may not be the case, and based on other incidents, the driver was a really bad driver anyway, but it worries me that no one seems to be considering the firm's involvement in this, not even the judge.",false,true,t1_ck8u1k2,ninj3,Oxfordshire,0,1409827945,t5_2qhqb,t3_2ffnmy,t3_2ffnmy,15,1427202944,0,0,ck8u1k2,unitedkingdom,15,,eng-Oxfordshire,

Well, that's where you're wrong. This is a wrong assumption. You aren't exactly the same in heaven. You are never tired, sick, bored, you never grow old, you don't dislike anything or anyone because there is nothing to dislike and there is always something to do.

""Wouldn't you eventually get used to the burning and torture if you're gonna be there for eternity?""

Do people get used to orgasming and become bored of it? Do people say ""ahh not sex again, been doing it for 10 years already, so boring"" ? Do most people stop having sex after doing it a few hundred times ? No they don't.

Considering AAP's pre-election rhetoric about how Congress was evil personified. Any kind of tie-up with them should have been unacceptable if they were really a party of principle.(AK repeatedly said they'd rather sit in opposition than tie up with any other party.)

The only reason AK/AAP tied up was so that they could blame Congress for their short lived govt. and win a clear majority in the elections that followed because of a sympathy wave. They most likely thought that the assembly would be dissolved once they quit and the re-elections would be held along with the LS elections.

Unfortunately for them, both Congress and BJP scuttled their plans and they'll have to wait a whole year and in the meantime their dismal performance in the LS elections has blown AAP's credibility to shreds.

"I must've missed the quote in the article itself.  That said, it's still flawed.  Not nearly every single person who would otherwise have gotten an abortion if they were legal would now pursue an illegal abortion; this is absurd.  There are, I strongly suspect, a sizable portion of people who feel as though they are forced to proceed with the pregnancy and do just that.  Again, I agree that abortion laws will never prevent all abortions, for the reasons you and others have given, but treating it like there are not a large chunk of people who aren't willing to break the law and subject themselves to unsafe conditions to get one seems unreasonable to me.

And yeah... it is about control.  Why is this disturbing?  Why is it that people so often conflate acknowledgement of a reality with a sanctioning of that reality? Noting that abortion laws are about control does not require that I approve of these laws; I think you are perhaps reading some weird content in my comment.  I thought it was kind of obvious to all parties involved that part of the issue, beyond opposing world views and ethical systems, was a pretty transparent and time-honored desire to control essentially every aspect of female sexuality, pregnancy and birth included.

With respects to your claim that the number of young women without Internet access is low, please source this.  I have done research into this in the past several years for other reasons that note that Internet access is still pretty firmly divided along socioeconomic lines and that the types of people with low income who are often most in need of abortions also often lack access to the technology you're referring to.

Also, Internet access is not even an especially good measure of this.  Such statistics can account for things like nearby libraries that in practice do not receive as much use as a *person arguing on the Internet* thinks they might.  Point being, you are arguing from a position where you already have Internet access and seem to be extrapolating from this how easy it is for someone in an entirely different position to do the legwork.  I would argue that someone in an entirely different position might not even consider doing Internet research to begin with, and might approach the problem from a different perspective altogether.

"there are lots of friendly people, I once spawned in vybor at the same time someone else did, we both ran in different directions right away probably thinking the same thing ""he's going to kill me""




5 minutes later we ended up meeting each other again at the police station, he had a gun now and I had a pickaxe, I wasn't sure if he had any ammo or not, so I was very paranoid and kept my eyes on him the whole time




I start heading towards the base near vybor and he is still following me, we find a little bit of loot at the base and a few guns, at this point I figured he had found ammo if he didn't already have any, so I was expecting to be killed but he didn't try to do anything to me



At this point we are both pretty geared up, he had 2 guns, I had 2, but I had no ammo for either of mine, I figured we would split up now and probably not see him ever again, I head towards NWAF and about half way there I look behind me and see him following at a distance, I get to the first jail at NWAF and continue looking for more loot with my newly found friend but we don't find much



We then start heading towards the ATC and as soon as we get close to the airstrip we spot a heli crash, we both pause, quickly hit the ground(I should probably mention this is on a full 50 man server), I break the silence and type to him ""There is a heli crash, watch out, we might be spotted already"", he replies with ""yeah I see it"", I tell him ""I'm going to run for it and check for gear, cover me, if I take shots and go down I wish you luck on your adventure"", he then tells me ""I got you, don't worry""



I stand up, quickly start running across the field, zig-zagging, whoopty-whoppin' anybody that might be about to snipe me down, I reach the heli and start looking around it as fast as I can, I don't find anything but a few M4 clips, I run back to him and we quickly get behind cover, I inform him of what I found and everything else.



Skip ahead 15-20 minutes of searching the whole airfield, and we rotate all the way around and back to the same place we started, the jail, this time we both had ammo and we were just going to watch for people, we end up spotting two guys looting the heli crash and they start running towards the hangers, we begin to move across the airfield towards them(yes we wanted to kill them, some might say it's fucked up, but hey, NWAF, we don't expect anyone there to be friendly)



Half way across the airstrip we spot three more players, we quickly hit the ground(once again like scared little kids haha), we start telling each other ""they are all most likely together"", so there we are stuck in the middle of the airstrip, thinking we are about to die, using only a bit of grass to stay hidden, expecting to be sniped any moment



We keep watching them through our scopes, waiting to see what will happen, the first two players we spotted are sitting in the very last hanger, close to the heli crash, we keep eyes on the other 3 players as they begin to move into that hanger(we are thinking they are just regrouping), they start to enter the hanger with the other two and gunfire starts between the two vs three, the three players win the short lived firefight and quickly loot the bodies and begin running away towards the tent end of the airstrip



Once they are at a decent distance where we think we wont be spotted, we start trying to follow them, but 30 seconds into running(we make it behind the ATC), we start taking fire from somewhere near the hangers, we panic and run into the ATC, shut the doors and hide, using the windows to watch all around us, I go up top and keep watch, I never end up spotting anyone



Skip ahead another ten minutes, we decide whoever shot at us is probably gone, we make a plan to quickly make a run for it behind the fire station and to the woods for safety, I tell him to go first and I'll cover from up top, we both wish each other good luck and he takes off out the doors, as I'm watching him he runs behind the fire station and as soon as he is out of my sight, I hear shots, about 3 or 4 shotgun shots



I start freaking out and thinking ""NO! They killed him!! It's all my fault!"", I jump up with my gun ready, run out of the ATC towards where the shots were, hoping to save him if there is still a chance, I take shot from a sniper somewhere, start running towards the hangers, go in between the first two hangers and look behind them, I spot a dead body and two players



I'm now thinking the dead body is my friend and they killed him, I run out and towards them spraying with my SKS, just trying to go out with a vengeance for him, I drop one of them and take a few shots from an AK(I don't know how I'm not dead at this point), I want to kill the second one but I am now out of ammo



I run to the very back wall near the forest and take another shot, my leg is now broken and I'm rolling now to try to get to cover, I make it to the wall and bandage up/use my splint, I see the guy helping his friend that I shot but I can't do anything about it, I move along the wall very quietly to try to spot them after they run off then all of the sudden..



I see in the chat, my new friend ""Are you still alive?! I'm hiding back here, I don't know if you can see this or not"", as I go to reply to him, ""YES YES YES OH MY GOD!!"" the server resets and it's all over.. I never end up finding him again on the server but he was the best fresh spawn buddy anyone could ever ask for..

"Well, not really, because at that point WN8 would become irrelevant, true, but...

At that point, you can introduce a general global ranking of players, a la Dota or Starcraft - either a general matchmaking rating, or an actual numerical rank. The former'd probably be better than the latter because of the big-team nature of WoT.

Everybody's WR would normalize, yes, but then clans could recruit based off what a potential recruit's MMR is, because MMR does not; if somebody were to rack up a 90% WR in a given day, MMR would adjust them upward until they were no longer winning more than ~50% of the time. It's impossible to adjust your MMR except downward by willfully throwing games or upward by getting better.

Now, WR can be cheesed somewhat, via platooning primarily. So the solution to that would be to have a system akin to Dota 2, where you have a separate party MMR and a solo MMR. Here, it'd be solo-queue MMR and platoon MMR. Clans would be interested in both; solo MMR is a good indication of the individual player's skill, and while platoon MMR would be very much secondary, a high solo MMR and a low platoon MMR would indicate somebody who simply does not work well with others.

I'll note that since any intelligently-done MM system like this uses brackets and not absolute ranking except at the highest levels, games will still be varied and different and there will still be variations.

"I know I'm going to get downvoted to hell, but expanding the lore would be a terrible idea for Riot.

Before you DO downvote me, please just understand that I like the game, I just don't think that expanding lore would be a good idea.

a) No one ACTUALLY cares about the lore of their champs - you're not going to not play a champ if you don't know their lore.

b) The game doesn't need lore - no offense, but this is a game whose entire plot is ""with 4 other people, attack 5 guys, kill robot-minions without souls, steal money, ... there's a dragon..., destroy buildings, you win."" There couldn't even be 10-show TV program made for this game (unless you RE~~~EALLY stretched it).

c) Instead of lore, focus on fixing game issues - resources cost money, and writing lore is time spent NOT fixing the game. I'm MUCH more worried about the DDOS hacks against NA servers.

d) Expanding lore means Riot is limiting itself - If you have detailed lore, you have to start making rules (where does the magic come from, who are the gods of the world, who makes the metal, etc. etc.). When you have rules, you have limits. When your source of champions is ""whatever we feel like"", you don't want to have to justify why there's suddenly a robot coming out a farming village in a poor country. 

""All of a sudden, there's a new Lannister in Game of Thrones... we haven't mentioned him yet because... ermmm... ermmm...."", or ""Oh, Gokuu had another kid... before he died... he went back in time when he was dead... and... umm....""

"Definitely, multiple backups are smart thinking.. you should consider using different media types.  I like the ironkey because it has a built in backup solution which exports an encrypted backup in case the drive is lost.  I use the version with SLC NAND, not the MLC.

Many of my disks I burned long ago are unreadable.

"There are multiple issues with timeshares, what it essentially comes down to is the ""investment"" is not liquid and rarely does it every see a return.  What I mean by the investment is not liquid is, it cannot be turned into cash very quickly.  The timeshare re seller market is very large, and the people looking to sell timeshares is exponentially larger than those looking to buy.  
When you purchase a timeshare as soon as you leave the meeting, your investment begins to depreciate.  This is similar to buying a new car, once you purchase the timeshare it becomes ""used"" and loses much of its value.  There are cases where the location of the timeshare suddenly becomes popular and you may see a slight increase in value, but the majority of times you will lose a good portion of the money you put in.

"I wouldn't say it's typical to feel that squeamish about sex and lack desire towards your partner-- it's not something I've ever experienced. However, sexuality is complicated and there's a large spectrum of feelings, so I also wouldn't say there's anything wrong with you feeling that way right now, especially if you are inexperienced. 

Honestly, I think you may want to see a therapist, particularly one who focuses on sex and relationships. It sounds like you may have some intimacy and sex issues that you can work on. Of course, it is possible that you are asexual or have a complicated sexuality. If that's the case it's okay, but you may need to reevaluate what sort of relationship works for you and your partner. Also, the fact that you did eventually start to feel passion when kissing, even if it took you longer than most people, is a good sign. It means that you're capable of those feelings, so perhaps sex will be the same way-- just a slow start until you get used to it. 

You also may feel squeamish about sex for any number of reasons, from bad past experiences to feeling guilty (maybe you come from a religious background?) and more. I think it's going to be very difficult and confusing for you to figure this all out on your own right now, but a good therapist will know what questions to ask you to help lead you there. In the meantime, take things slow with your partner. See if you can get more used to his body, even if it's something as simple as hugging him while he has his shirt off. If you start feeling more comfortable, you can progress to things like touching. You don't have to do everything at once and jump straight into sex. You may feel better with having him touch you first, because perhaps experiencing sexual pleasure from him will jump start your desire for him. You'll probably want to discuss this with him in some capacity-- you don't necessarily need to tell him the thought of touching his genitals makes you squeamish, but just that you are inexperienced and need to take things super slow, but it's something you want to work on with him. If you start feeling better about it through all of that then you may not even need a therapist, but I suspect if you are still feeling that way then it couldn't hurt to talk to someone that has a better understanding of these issues.

That's not true. Trans men get harassed by feminists sometimes just for being trans men or for deciding to transition. Some trans men who are feminists get accused of having male privilege if they look and act like regular dudes and don't tell people they are trans, or they get told the only reason they transitioned was to get male privilege.

"Just a couple bits of advice:

Circular saw, jig saws, and band saws are not very precise tools.  If you're planning on making a box with hardwoods then you will be needing a table saw as a bare minimum.  Depending on where you live, there are shops that allow you to use their tools (can't remember what they are called) and have extensive amounts of precision tools.  This might be a better option than your cousins house.

Both the woods you suggest are possible, but I would suggest Oak as it is readily available, fairly cheap (cheaper than both maple and cherry) and easy to work with.

From my understanding you are planning on making a box with a press fit lid, these need a lot of precision to make work properly.  A dual sided box with a piano hinge on one side and a latch on the other might be a little easier to make.  [Here's the basic idea... forgive the 10 second drawing.](http://i.imgur.com/kcRpua1.jpg)

"People often blame their being an asshole on their introverted-ness. From what I read you go into your relationships with extreme cynicism, put almost no effort into them, and then are disappointed when they are ""meaningless"". Think about it, if you expect to take something and not give it back towards the end of a relationship, you probably are not projecting a very positive image towards your ""friend"". Have you ever considered that maybe that ""douchiness"" is caused by them picking up on the fact that you have already begun to cut ties with them? I would be offended if I saw somebody trying to let me go or ""steer the relationship in their favor"" while I still considered them my friend. Introversion is characterized by ""the state of or tendency toward being wholly or predominantly concerned with and interested in one's own mental life"", what you have here is not an introvert problem, this is a cynicism problem. 

This may sound corny, but you get out of a friendship what you put into it.

&gt;Released from the *[Summer Breeze](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summer_Breeze_(album\))* album, Seals and Crofts' original version reached number six on the US [pop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop_(music\)) singles chart. Bruce Eder of [Allmusic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allmusic) referred to it as ""one of those relentlessly appealing 1970s harmony-rock anthems,"" ""appropriately ubiquitous on the radio and in the memory"".  One of the distinctive backing instruments on ""Summer Breeze"" is a child's [toy piano](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toy_piano). The single reached #6 pop, #4 easy listening on the U.S. *[Billboard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billboard_(magazine\))* charts in autumn 1972.

&gt;Seals and Crofts performed the song live on a 1972 [Bobby Darin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bobby_Darin) show. The Isley Brothers performed it on a 1974 [Soul Train](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soul_Train) show.

&gt;The song was used in the 1993 cult film *[Dazed and Confused](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dazed_and_Confused_(film\))*, and appeared on the second soundtrack to the film, 1994's *Even More Dazed and Confused*. It was also used in the 2007 film *[King of California](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_of_California)*, starring [Evan Rachel Wood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evan_Rachel_Wood) and [Michael Douglas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Douglas).

&gt;The track was remixed by [Philip Steir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_Steir) and Ramin Sakurai in 2004 as part of *What Is Hip? Remix Project Volume One*, an album featuring remixes of [Warner Bros. Records](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warner_Bros._Records) 1970s hits.  This updated version, titled ""Summer Breeze (Tsuper Tsunami Mix)"", was also featured in two 2004 commercials by clothing retailer [Gap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gap_(clothing\)), starring models [Bridget Hall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridget_Hall) and [Jessica Miller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jessica_Miller_(fashion_model\)) respectively.

&gt;""Summer Breeze"" was featured on the 2011 season finale of *[CSI: Miami](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSI:_Miami)*.

&gt;The track was also used in the 2007 animated TV special *[Shrek the Halls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shrek_the_Halls)* and the 2009 movie, *[Land of the Lost](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land_of_the_Lost_(film\))*.

&gt;The track can be heard in *The Return*, an episode of the first season of the [TV show](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TV_show) [Girls (TV series)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Girls_(TV_series\)).

&gt;The track is also heard in the episode ""Dead Dogs and Gym Teachers"" of *[Freaks and Geeks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freaks_and_Geeks)*.

&gt;In an episode of *[How I Met Your Mother](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_I_Met_Your_Mother)*, season one [Matchmaker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matchmaker), Ted claims ""Summer Breeze"" as his 'guilty pleasure' song.

"Ooh boy, this didn't disappoint. As you seem to acknowledge (maybe? i'm not sure) the whole kiss sequence is actually a lot *better* in crystal than it was in classic. It's a spur of the moment thing rather than a premeditated 'grab and sequester a drunk child for kissing', and regardless of whatever emotional truth Tuxedo Mask thinks the interaction has, there's actually a counterpoint acknowledged to the supposed romance in the form of Luna showing up and asking what we were thinking. 

With regard to your actual grievances with the crystal version of the scene, I see where you're coming from, that's the sort of material I'd write too if I was so inclined. But I dunno, it's anime. There's a whole lot of stuff with a whole lot more unimpressive politics, and I'm certainly not gonna break down why I think each one sucks. I assume you're coming from a place of disappointment based on your experiences with classic, but from my point of view classic's been a bumpy ride as well. If anything you've just given me implicit assurance that Classic will maintain an upward trajectory (at least for a while), which is nice.

"first, ive never seen a ziggs really heavily on his r where its notable of people qqing so hard for nerfs. Second, bug fixes? yup you're are right any champ who gets bug fixes should have there name thrown in to a pile of champs who need nerfs. Third, what more damage to outer part? I know that the CLOSER to the center you are the more damage you take, and the only thing that changed about his ult was the increased damage to minions. Fourth, Satchel charge knocking back farther away, well why shouldnt it before it would launch you a small distance and the enemy a tiny bit, so basicall with his movement speed being pretty bad there would be no point in having it (so id say that is justified, especially since it is still a high cooldown). FifthCool down reductions and mana cost, first the cooldowns on the satchel charge wasnt that much and again justified because its his only escape and mana wasnt that huge either, he can still run out of mana relatively quick.

Lastly calling my comments ""bullshit"" i consider bullshit, and why shouldn't i defend my favorite champ against people who want him nerfed to oblivion because because they can't handle playing against him (again it isnt that hard to beat him with the right champion selection and gameplay) xD

* **Clothes**: She recently claimed I had ""more than enough"" baby clothes, so I went through the pile and wrote a categorized list. In newborn and 0-3 month sizes, I had 10 onesies, a pair of shorts, a pair of pants, and two sleep-suit thingies. It was actually a helpful exercise since now I know what to actually look for and buy, but still. She was so condescending when I said ""I'm pretty sure I don't...""

* **Car seat**: I don't own a car, so months and months ago she said she'd buy the car seat. I thought she had it covered; turns out she didn't think about her offer since. Now she's all pissy because I'd rather buy a convertible seat than an infant bucket seat + multiple bases + stroller combo, because the second option would be more convenient for her. BUT she's not willing to pay for the convenience... she wants to buy a *used* seat!! One of the two major baby items you're absolutely *not* supposed to buy used!!! Ugh.

"Alright, so according to me, democracy has the same inherit flaw fascism or dictatorships do. And that's finding the right guy to put in charge. Most people I talk to agree, a dictatorship isn't always too horrible of an idea, but the right guy needs to be in power. This is tricky, but possible. For example, Yugoslavia and Singapore, two countries with excellent dictators that excelled compared to other options they could've faced (Yugoslavia without Tito, Singapore without an army). Now in democracy, or representative democracy, as that's what most people support when they say they believe in democracy, is inherently corrupt, at least in the modern age. Money is *required* to win an election. You need a very large initial investment (even with a two party system) to have a chance of winning an election. Now there are some guys who will go out and do it for the greater good, and spend their money fulfilling a childhood dream, but let's face it; there are only some. The rest, especially as the position becomes more and more important, are doing it (more than not) for the money. Humans naturally do what's profitable, that's how capitalism, and natural selection in nature works. If there's an easier way to do something, someone will find it and (in most cases) beat his/her competition. In a representative democracy, money is needed to get in, and only people with enough money are going to get in. Does this mean every senator is filthy rich? No, but the people backing them are. And as I've gone over, those people aren't doing it cause it's the nice thing to do, they're doing it to get a return on their investments. In a modern democracy, companies *will* invest money in candidates to have better representation for *their individual company* than they would elsewise. The fact of the matter is, the more money you have, the stronger if a say you have in politics. The average American has a roughly 1/150,000,000 say in who becomes president (ignoring electoral college). In my state you have roughly a 1/700,000 say on who represents you at congress (assuming every one votes, I don't know the participation percentage in these elections). Now I can't make hard evidence for how much more of a say a company that had made a donation has in your congressman congress(wo)man's decision, but I'd imagine it's more than your measly 1/100,000 (at best). Public opinion still matters, but that is so easily changed by money, as a politician's decision, that by the rules of natural selection, only the most corrupt but smart enough to hide it will get reelected.

I bring this up because a number of years ago my family and I noticed an odd purplish tint to the sunlight around twilight. Not up in the sky (didn't look) - but in the environment, everything looked as if the light shining on it was no longer white sunlight but slightly purple light.

Sexual Orientation: Pansexual or trisexual depending on how you look at it.
Gender:  Pre-transition female(female mind with male body wanting to become a women)
Where I live: Suburb of Indianapolis Indiana

Stress factor:  living in a body that you just don't match with.  I have always loved girly things but not being considered a women makes it so I can't enjoy these things publicly.  This is something that has bothered me for a long time, to the point where it created an eatting disorder, self harm, and made me seriously contemplate burning my entire body to get rid of body hair.

"We'll have to wait 'til next week, when the demo lands, to have more concrete info.

&gt; Everyone is limited to one spell card now. I like this change. It'll be like IaMP or SF4 Ultras (minus the new Ultra W).

That we know of. It might be a system a la SWF, where you select a set of spellcards you can use and in which order.

&gt; Timer is still around. This is good.

It's the one thing that keeps coming back, *unlike Mima*. ;D

&gt; orbs below the timer? What does it mean? My best guess is that it could possibly be like the GRD system in Under Night In-Birth?

Probably a system similar to popularity in HM, but based on other in-game actions/metrics.

&gt; Reimu has much less meter than Marisa. Does that correspond to the spell card chosen? If so, is the meter for spirit or spell card fill?

Gonna go for Spell Card. Meter sizes correspond to the numerical sizes. 

&gt; And speaking of, what's the flames about? If the other meter is for spell card usage, does the flames mean it's for spirit usage, or something else?

Most likely spirit, or another similar mechanic.

More than likely the only character-specific mechanics  will not be like HM, only different spellcard costs and power.",false,false,t1_cn3jq5x,AnatoleSerial,.net,0,1419365287,t5_2qvi5,t3_2q5gli,t1_cn3i197,1,1425249127,0,0,cn3jq5x,touhou,1,,118,

 [**Frenulum of prepuce of penis**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frenulum%20of%20prepuce%20of%20penis): [](#sfw) 

---

&gt;

&gt;The word *[frenulum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frenulum)* on its own is often used for the __frenulum of prepuce of penis__, which is an elastic band of tissue under the [glans penis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glans_penis) that connects to the [prepuce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreskin), or [foreskin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreskin) to the vernal mucosa, and helps contract the prepuce over the glans.  In the event of [frenulum breve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frenulum_breve) or frenular chordee, or to ensure that the glans can be freely and completely exposed, the frenulum may be partially or totally removed.

"That is just silly.  You're saying every magistrate should wholeheartedly agree with every law or else quit their job?  Pretty much every person in America has at least one law they disagree with.  That would either mean no magistrates, or only over zealous crazy magistrates.  At least with someone sympathetic like my husband doing this job, he can make sure he sets bonds as low as he can for crimes like that.  If he quit his job, he would just be replaced by someone else, who probably wouldn't be as lenient as he is.

With any job, you have to take the bad with the good.  He may not like having to agree there was probable cause to arrest a kid with an ounce of pot, but he definitely likes being able to help put away child molesters and murderers.  Maybe the guy that would replace him would be more lenient to child pornographers or people that abuse the elderly.  At least my husband uses what leeway he has to make things harder for the truly bad guys and easier for those he sympathizes with.

"Ok, the things is as follows: 

Fuckers go out, and play. If they have fun, its all good, but if they don't, things may start strange. 

The part about the time travel paradoxon is a bit meh. 

How I would set up the story, to make it compliant with the storyline: 

Go to the astral rift created by dunkelzahn. Strange, right? Extatic, right? 

Now, include time travel in this. 

Sounds nice, doesn't it? 

Now, imagine the following. There is an explosion. Giant badda boom. 

(of course, you have pulled the relevant maps from google. Heck, I would even allow google as an in game ressource. )

The players crumble up, and they get the full apocalyptic sight of Ghostwalkers awakening. 

Stuff is burning, people are screaming, all that stuff. 

Now, imagine how much official attention would be payed to a couple of ""Kids""who are at a battlesite? 

The highest they would get would be ""get those civillians out of here"", and a couple of soliders staring at them, and making jokes if they get their gear out of salvation army boxes. 

Remember, Time travel  is THE holy grail of magic, and of people wanting to fuck with power. 

Now, do the full army war thing. Play a couple of insanely graphgic video games. get the ideas. 

BAM. Soldier in front of them gets shot. 
BAM, soldier that was rtheir designated contact gets shot. 

With that, they have the ability to start playing for themself. 

Play all the tropes of ""super special ops soldiers going ham"". 
Make the gear part of this, but not too obvious. 

Now, where you really want to hit it is the first adventuire should be about survival. They get picked up in the first front lines of combat, obviously civillians, and WHAM, their escorts get knocked out. 

I mean, heck, if you feel fancy, give them guns. Older models, that would be worthless to the stationed soldiers, the cache of a gang that got disposessed, and just have the soldier go, ""ok, you kids, hate to do this to you, but we could use every triggerfinger in heree....""

Everyone gets one gun, and a 20 clip of ammo.  If you want to play it hardcore, make it a revolver. 

Play the combat group style. They are obviously the least threat, so they will get attacked the least, unless they eatherfuck up, or make themself a target. 
In this case, let them suffer the full fear of ""Now I am going to get attacked"", but in the last second, have the attacker switch targets. 

Let them know that people die if they fuck up. 

Now, they need to meet locals, right? 

Imagine these youthfull 20.th century kids stumbling on a gang that has holed up with a couple of civillians in an old preschool. 

Basically,  this should come as a break between the fights. In the fights, go for tech and magic against horrors. Think bug city type of horrors

Now, by this time, the info the players should have gotten themself is as follows. 

- this aint kansas no more. You have been transported through space. 

- What the fuck was THAT? Magic is real

- for comedic relief, have most of the soldiers be from some religious outfit. Have them ask for the players SIN in tones that are designed to confuse the players. Like, instead of asking, wheree is your sin, civillian, have a soldier basically act as liason, and ask them WHAT and WHERE is your sin. act confgused when the players don't react like he expects, and then havce him get the Inspiration that ""Those are gangers / sinless"". Have him act on the kindness of a once sinless, and go ""Ok, I realize you don't want to tell, so here is the deal: you tell them you lost your sins in the first attacks, had to flee, all that shit, also mention that you want to see priests, because they have the best grub, but bail before they try to track you in the databases. ""
Make it clear that the soldiers take their not knowing as a sure sign of being either streetkids, or hipsters trying to act out ""2k-style"". Make it clear that the average soldier knows about as much of the 2014's as a kid of today knows about the 1920's.

Now, they are in the building, lying low. Gang is all around them and they get the taste of the other side of things. While the army was high tech, and impersonal, the gang is low tek, and very personal. You get introdiuced with names, most people don't have cyberware, and the theme should be utter poverty. Have them catch a break, and allow them to get additional info. 

- the gangers are kind of an outlying outfit, dedicated to the neighborhood watch. 
- the true muscles have disappeared, and the remains were left with instructions to guard the people they saved. 
- the time is 2070, and they are on war territory. 
- also, give them the exact situational opposite. The gangers and the neighbors are undereducated as shit, mostly children, and even the gangers that are still standing don't have much in the termsof school education. Make it apparent that even being able to read and write fluently makes you decisively upperclass. 
- Then, have one of the gangers get a message in. It is from high command. The city is being evacuated. The nearest evacuation checkpoint is 2 miles away. No car is coming for them. As it stands, they will have to make 2 miles in under an hour. 

Allow them a bit to plan. The gang will make the last rounds, to check, maybe even send one of them out as a scout, but they will have to move, quick. Give them, 10 minutes to come up with a plan. 

- for extra fun, ask for logistics. you have the following types of problems. Children that cry, or have lost their mother, or that suddenly dart away. Hurt gangers that need to be transported. People with crippling wounds, like the leg missing. Let themn make a plan on how they plan to transport all of those. Be hurtfully honest. Can they hot wire a car? whjat if they get a modell with a rigging cocoon, that has no manual controlls? How to bypass the enhanced safety mechanism? what if the car alarm comes onb, and in the peace and quiet, suddenly, the car howls, alerting everything in a 5 mile radius? Use this as an opportunity to allow the players to shine with unusual knowledge. For example, player wants to make a molotow? fine, suddenly, the party is armed. Give them out some of the skills that way. With the option, of course you don't tell them that, to later on relearn those skills. 

But yea, learning by doing. 

- have the players miss the checkpoint. Just by seconds. The chopper is in the air, people are screaming, heck the soldiers even throw them a bit of military grade stuff out, along with the obligatory ""head west"". WHOOOZE!
BAM!
Rocket, or any weapon the enemy has, blows the copter up. Give them a set round of actions to look for stuff. Weapons? Maps? Things? 
How do they deal when they notice some of the soldiers are not dead yet, and only dreeadfully hurt? Do they camp? Or, do they really get the situation, and manage to actually impress? because one of the soliders has a key to an old truck. Slow, leaking gas, some spare explosives in the back, but able to transport a lot of people. Heck, maybe even a simple drone. 

- Now, the big finale is that at the end of the evacuation period, the bombers are called in. Fuck, you can make it even thorhammers if you want. The city will be levelled. 
But there is one bridge still open, out of the city. Any surviving soldier will certainly tell them that the military saved this one for last, just to get some payback on the enemies. 

Will they hunker down? go on, in an apocalyptic speech, about how things have changed. How the corps rule everything. Make them hold a dying soldiers hand. Make them promise the kids that all will be OK. 
All while outside the world burns, and the bombs fall. uncertain if they themself will survive. 

Will they attempt to signal for help? Unlikely, but the military has made home in the suburbs. And in there, in an old atomic bomb shelter, there is a shadownet operator with an oldass CB radio, watching them over the matrix. If the players take care, and just remove a few harddrives from a server somewhere, he has an open maintennance tunnel, that will protect them, and what the hell, he can even hack a few drones for them. 

will they attempt to flee? Make it a car duel. Pull all the tropes. Go gangs, that try to capture the wagon. Things chasing them. Haviong to actually return fire, while a player ( 2070's can't drive stickshift, they only do autopilot) must drive. Have them go through hell. 

But the end is the same. They make it, in the last second, and gloriously so. Children, gangers, even the soldiers more or less alive. 

The more people alive, the better. The soldiers of the troop will pool their assets together, to get them the neccesities. 
Basically, a single credstick with roughly 100 Nuyen per surviving person they rescued, including themself. 
the gear they have? Surprise, the stuff is actually valuable. let them get half the book price for every bit of gear they save. 

(1 karma per person saved, by the way, including themself. )

The gangers will offer themself up as contacts. heck, make it one of the A-gangs, with a lot of connections, that owes them something. Smuggling them into seattle? Weapons? Money? Drugs? 

By this point, calculate how much you have given out as freebies. use the old ability charts, and track the ammount of buildpoints the characters have used. 

Offer them the opportunity to just spend more points on skills that they have used, but nothing out of the ordinary. Like, no knowing cybertech, or magic. 

However, there is still the advantage point. Want an Orc? a Dwarf? become a magician? 
Heck, that is what the game is about, and that is why you have stuff like ""latent orc, or latent magical potential. """,false,true,t1_cfoiqob,Meistermalkav,TacSoft,0,1393357801,t5_2s4v2,t3_1yuey5,t3_1yuey5,3,1432556344,0,0,cfoiqob,Shadowrun,3,,,

"The end result may or may not be the same. 

While it's true that many of the skills presented in pickup books are *effective*, I would argue that they lack authenticity and personality. 

I like guys who aren't afraid to be themselves, with all their flaws and strengths. If they're naturally awkward and try to work with that, that's adorable. If they are a little emotionally unavailable but happen to be working on it, that's great. I don't want an optimized process - I want people who are human. 

I suppose people who are actively dating do use those skills to a certain extent. And I agree with you - we're socialized to learn some of it. My biggest concern is that it hides peoples' personal fears and becomes a crutch. I'm interested in someone, it's for their character and personality, flaws and all, not for their ability to pick me up. 

Finally, there's a bit of an irrational dislike of pickup strategies. To me, it just *feels* inauthentic - in the end, it's people studying technique, and applying it on people. That's the key - it's not a hobby, where you practice on a violin, or work on your baking recipes. It's the optimization of one of humanity's most mysterious processes (romance) that makes me doubt it. Maybe it's the romantic in me (and I haven't thought of myself as romantic in ages), but I personally dislike anything that combines manipulation and socialization. I know we love to watch House of Cards, but if you actually *knew* someone as conniving and almost sociopathic as Frank Underwood, would you want to be him?

"Quick tip: If you have space/time to type ""question regarding ~,"" you can generally follow rule 2 and type the question.

&gt; Would you guys help me in differentiating when to use ちかく or となり when describing how close/near a subject is?

I felt gypped when I came here ready to describe いく and くる and this was your question instead.

となり means something is next to you. ちかい means something is nearby. All となり things are ちかい but not all ちかい things are となり.

&gt; Another set of location words I'm having trouble with is むこう and むかい

This is also not what your post title is talking about...

むこう is a noun that means ""over there"" in a far sense, like across the river or over the horizon. It is often, as your teacher explained, used when there's something between you and the ""over there.""

むかい is a noun that means ""over there"" in the near sense, like ""across the street"" or ""across the hall."" It's generally talking about a (relatively small) passable distance.

&gt; And then I use くる when I am to go to a place where the listener is.

No. You use いく when you go to the place where the listener is because you are going.

If the subject is going, then いく. If the subject is coming, then くる.

&gt; But in both cases wouldn't I be leaving the place where I'm speaking from and thus the usage of いく would suffice?

"I guess it falls under religious thinking, but the idea that there's any objective, ""real"" thing as morality or meaning, or that there are metaphysically good or bad ways to live a life. There are outcomes we prefer and efficient/idiotic ways to achieve them but there really isn't any rule book out there, written by a god or built into reality by accident. Success is not defined.

"I think the long-term problem for Swiss watch makers is that wearing one of their watches means *not* wearing an Apple Watch. A $10 quartz watch and a $30,000 luxury timepiece do the exact same thing, so you can switch between them with no downside. But, perhaps a few years from now, if you've become used to using your Apple Watch and its many (not even thought of yet) features, then there is a real cost to taking it off. Why wear a Swiss watch even for special occasions when it means you can't wear your Apple Watch? I think that becomes the real issue. It wasn't a problem when all watches were *functionally* interchangeable, but asking someone to seriously downgrade the utility of what they're wearing is different.

"Surely you see the irony in trusting two state funded and owned media corporations, one owned by an oligarch/""king"" in a religiously repressed state, the other in a country where the government is openly trying to silence a newspaper editor to destroy information related to Edward Snowden. Reuters is extremely homogenous and follows state rules for materials to be covered. My sources aren't any more sketchier then yours, at least the sources I've cited can be traced to the individuals reporting. Yours is a trust of mega corporations with thousands of individuals, a majority of who are accountable to the government. This also include Reuters as the states where Reuters news is distributed can choose to yank its license if it fails to uphold government doctrine.
