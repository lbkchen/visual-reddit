"What's your priority selection?  

I see you've got skilljack and -wires. While I really like them from a fluff standpoint, they're really bad mechanically. You're almost certainly better off putting your ressources at a lower priority, and instead picking skills at a higher.  

This ties into the fact that your social skill aren't that impressive for a face. You could squeeze out an extra dice by taking one of the high-fashion armors that give you a social dice pool bonus.  
If you take the Ace of Cups for example, it's only 600¥ more expensive than the Actioneer, but you get armor 9, and a +1 to your social limit and dice pool. *And* you can get a Synergist Business Longcoat to stack for a +3 armor (if you do this and try to wear your ballistic mask at the same time you will encure encumbrance penalties due to your strength of 2).  

You could also use some of the money you spent on skillwires to pick up tailored pheromones to make you even more effective at facing.  

I would recommend getting a smartlink implant to make full use of your guns' smartgun systems.  

The rigger control on your vehicle is pretty useless since you don't have a control rig.

2001 was being true to it's nature and the initial promise of what it was, Sunshine not so much.

EDIT: For what it's worth, I also think the ending of 2001 is its weakest part, with HAL being its strongest part. However I recognize everything was properly built up and nothing overstayed its welcome. The movie started with a visual trip signifying the evolution of humanity and ended in a very similar note. I didn't expect anything else from it, even though I liked the HAL segment much better. With Sunshine I felt they didn't know what the movie was two-thirds through.

"It's completely against the law, but to fight them you need time and money. Both are in short supply for most people. Fortunately, the OP had time and was able to get through the bullshit. 

Bell is one of the most despicably companies I've ever dealt with. I recently was forced to try to sign up for their service for a client's business as they had the fastest Internet service in our area (50/10).  After getting the line and equipment, it turns out that it's only 50/10 speed if you use their router on their modem/router box. If the business needs to see the external IP, the Bell equipment has to be in bridge mode and speed drops to 30/10. 

At the point I figured this out, it was 2 days into a 3 year contract and I called them up to cancel since they couldn't provide me with the 50/10 service I signed up for. The amount of bullshit they threw at me was incredible. I was told the following:

* The sales rep told you about the limitations on bridge mode. (No, he did not. I recorded the call. Want to hear it?)
* We advertise the service as 'up to 50mb', you aren't guaranteed to get that speed. (Really? So why do you have a 25mb tier? Why aren't all your services advertised as 50mb?  Plus, it doesn't actually say 'up to' on any of the documentation you sent me)
* You committed to a contract and we can't break that. (I committed to a service you can't provide. Since you can't provide the service, you've broken the contract on your end.)
* Why do you want the external IP on your equipment? (Why wouldn't I? I don't need to justify my requirements to you.)

Even their tech support is trained in double-talk. I kept asking the tech support rep if there was any way for my equipment to get the external IP and still get 50/10 speeds. He kept avoiding the question and telling me that Bridge mode will allow me to get the external IP. He wouldn't answer anything about speed. 

Bell can fuck right off and die. 

I called Teksavvy and we'll be getting 2x 25/10 lines.  Big downside is that a Bell tech has to install the lines.

I didn't want the stigma attached to it so I never told anyone, although a friend of mine's uncle who was a psychologist or psychiatrist I forget which who taught a class at my college told her to keep an eye on me because I was depressed. 

I know this because she told me laughing about it because I was such a happy person. She didn't believe it and was like ""Yea my uncle said that you're depressed and you're covering it up and you're very good at it but he can tell."" I laughed it off saying something like ""What the hell? Anyone who knows me know's i'm not even remotely depressed."" Meanwhile on the inside I was thinking ""what the fuck? How can he possibly tell?"" 

I couldn't talk to him about it, he wasn't allowed to counsel students he was teaching but I was very careful with all mannerisms, to this day I don't know what clued him in. ",false,false,t1_cmv3w8g,chrono14,,0,1418609731,t5_2qh1i,t3_2pba47,t3_2pba47,27,1425430065,0,0,cmv3w8g,AskReddit,27,,,

the biggest impact is the timeline. the result of the appeal isn't much help since peterson and rice's cases are different. 

as for the timeline, rice's hearing was november 5th &amp; 6th. the ruling came 22 days later.

peterson's hearing is set for december 2nd. if the ruling takes the same amount of time, we should get a decision sometime around christmas, which is not a good sign for hopeful FFers.

as for the issues at stake, rice was suspended formally twice: once for the incident and a second time for ""lying"" in relation to the incident. peterson was formally only suspended once by the league. i'd expect peterson's team and the NFLPA will def argue at appeal that peterson has also been punished twice: coerced into going on the exempt list and then getting suspended later, but that's going to be a different argument and the fact that rice won his appeal has no real bearing on peterson's case.

"&gt; Ziggy is our HM slave, and probably doesn't mind her lot. May bear a relation to the others we have. Quite possibly a secret agent, whether of this timeline's Bill, another timeline's Bill, or someone else entirely. Kind of a derp I'm thinking.

Zigzagoony prefers the title of ""HM Maestro,"" seeing as her role is far, FAR too important to be labelled with such a derogatory term as ""slave."" After all, without her, you guys can't go all that far.

And she had a sister/relative/body double in the other Zigzagoony, so I'm thinking Zigzagoony is either a family name or a clan name.

"[Witchvox](http://www.witchvox.com/) lists a lot of covens. Some are bad about replying to inquiries and some are old and no longer together. But many active covens out there have active listings on there.

You can also try to get in touch with your local Pagan community and find out through them. Meetup.com seems to be a good resource for many pagan groups so put in your town and look through the groups in the area. They aren't always called something obvious, depending on the location, but it's another good place to look.

Metaphysical shops may know groups in the area too if you have any you go to. They benefit a lot from knowing the community. I know out here there's a few shops that are so involved that people who live over an hour away know them by name.

"&gt;and now I've read (here and here) that a lot off women basically find new relationships fairly easy.

Sounds like you're confusing ""one night stand"" with ""new relationship"".

&gt;I feel in my condition I have to put everything on everything just to keep a relationship going...

If you're in a relationship like that, then it's not the right one for you. The thing is, in most failed relationships there's one person who put more work into it than the other. It's just as likely to be a woman in that scenario, and in fact, it's proven that men are more likely to cheat. Taking that into consideration relationships don't seem to be that much easier for women, imo.

Anyway, having to try really hard to keep a relationship afloat is a typical problem in deteriorating relationships. And it's difficult to accept because, naturally, most of our romantic relationships will fail at some point. But if that problem keeps on coming up for you, it's because you enter relationships with people who are flaky and don't fully appreciate you. If you had a string of these interactions I'd say you probably aren't confident enough to be picky and wait out for someone special.

But, in your previous posts you've only mentioned two situations... sounds like to me you've had very limited experience and you're judging the entire dating world on just a couple of women. I'm sure you really want to dissect those interactions so you can become better and have that stuff never happen again, but that can't happen. There's no way to make dating safe. No risk, no reward, right? And just because it didn't work out doesn't mean you did anything wrong. There are SO MANY people in this world, finding the right person is a matter of luck and time. Not every woman will like you, not every woman will be attracted to you, and that's ok, that doesn't mean there's something wrong with you that you have to change!",false,false,t1_cmcs11s,poffin,♀,0,1416939251,t5_30m5u,t3_2naftn,t3_2naftn,1,1425845711,0,0,cmcs11s,askwomenadvice,1,,female,

"You're absolutely not being selfish.  This is really insensitive of your FH.  Best case, he doesn't really get how much it means to you (although I don't know how he could miss it) and just made a spur of the moment decision without really thinking.  If that's true, best to hash it out now and get that stress off of you.

If he really meant it, and wants to have a mother-son dance KNOWING how heartwrenching it's going to be for you, then I think you need to have a much more serious talk.  You feel selfish wanting to deny him the dance, but I'd say if he wants to have a dance knowing how much it hurts you then that is just as selfish.  (OK, I think it's a lot more selfish).  

I agree with others that on the day itself, you're likely to be wrapped up so many happy emotions that you'll be fine.  (My dad passed away two years ago, and while I thought of him a lot that day, I only broke down once).  But to just stare at them dancing for a solid minute or whatever it is - I don't know.  The point is, neither does your FH, and I'd hope he'd err on the side of not making things miserable for you.  

Talk to him, you have a valid and real concern.  Don't feel like it's just selfish.

It is widely accepted for a man to joke about raping another man, even though male rape cases are almost as high as female cases, although the majority of male rape happens in prison.

"Having Event Horizon for Black Hole contradicts both Frozen Orb and Sparkflint.

If you use Absolute Zero instead, with at least 2 mobs getting hit means 6% increased cold damage for 10 seconds. On a pack of mobs Absolute Zero will give you more increased damage than all of Elemental Exposure. 

It gets even better with the Spellsteal rune, now instead increasing ALL damage you deal by 3% per mob, but at the cost of its duration (down to 5 seconds) so this is potentially better than Absolute Zero if you are going multi element.

And the fire bolt that Sparkflint fires off can only hit 1 enemy, limiting its usefulness against packs of mobs where you would be using Black Hole. 

You're better off using Cannoneer to apply arcane damage towards EE. The arcane splash from Cannoneer can be quite significant, especially if it is benefiting from 15-20% increased damage from EE.

"Ok, so, I work at a bank as a fraud investigator and I can give you a little insight on this.

It's correct that if a check is deposited twice, once electronically and once physically, the bank who holds the physical item gets ""dibs."" The bank where the physical deposit happened will send an adjustment to the bank who accepted the e-deposit. Bank #2 then has to send the money to bank #1. 

This is why it's vital to destroy the physical check after you e-deposit it. I know that in the terms of use for my bank's mobile deposit feature, there's a clause that says that we aren't responsible if you fail to destroy the check and someone steals it and deposits it again. We might make an exception, but it's up to you to properly destroy the check. We can't enforce that. 

In terms of preventing someone from opening future bank accounts in your name, if you put a fraud alert on your credit report, it will require a bank to call you if someone tries to open an account in your name. When the bank runs the report on you as part of standard account opening procedure, the fraud alert will appear. I'm not sure of a way to check to see if any other accounts have already been opened in your name, though, unless they have been sent to collections due to an overdrawn balance. Here's a helpful link for steps you can take: http://identitytheftnetwork.org/gethelp/new-accounts-opened-in-my-name

I don't know about what your recourse might be for getting your money back... but I have a feeling you may be out of luck. It depends on what the terms are for e-deposit at your own bank. It's possible that they'll refund you for the loss since it was due to fraud, but unlikely, since it was ultimately your error that led to the fraud occuring (unless I'm misunderstanding your story). You can, and should, send a letter to the bank where the account was fraudulently opened, and tell them to close it: http://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0281-sample-letters-and-forms-victims-identity-theft

"This isn't the answer you're looking for because I'm a broken record whenever I see posts on here about air mattresses.  I would highly recommend going with a sleeping pad vs. an air mattress.  One reason is the air inside the mattress cools down overnight causing it to lose pressure and make it uncomfortable to sleep.  The other is you have to have a pump to inflate them.

I camp monthly with my son's Boy Scout troop and swear by my [Thermarest Luxury Map XL](http://www.cascadedesigns.com/therm-a-rest/mattresses/camp-and-comfort/luxurymap/product) sleeping pad.  It's a car camping type pad and when fully inflated provides about 3"" of closed cell foam comfort.  I've had the same one for at least 5 years and it's still just as good as the day I bought it.  There are several other types of very good pads, I'm just using my tried and trusted model as an example.

"I started to type this out when I remembered that I'd already done it a couple of years ago to take to my psychiatrist. Reading through it now, it's a very jumbled collection of thoughts and is centered more on the context and the fallout rather than the blame itself, and the general tone's a bit too wallowing-in-self-pity. I'll try to fix it up a little, but it needs major rewrites and I'm not going to do that.

For backstory, when I was 2, the government (rightly) took me away from my mother and put me with foster parents. After some time had passed, I started spending some time with my mother and her other kids, and this is the story of the day that stopped.

When I was about 10 or so, my foster mother’s alcoholism had reached its peak, so had my foster father’s work schedule because he couldn’t stand to be around her, and the bullying at school was completely out of control.

But when my foster mother would drink until she passed out, or lock me out of the house and threaten to never let me back in, I knew I could come to my mother's place rather than be forced to stay and deal with her. It was always fun, and I usually got along well with everyone. Turned out my siblings were pretty cool dudes. My foster mother would always be angry when I came back for choosing my first family over her, but that didn’t matter, it was better than having to deal with her all day.

Then came the day when someone drank all the milk before breakfast, mother decided it was me and literally (yes the real usage, not the silly one) spent the rest of the day smashing things and screaming about what a greedy little cowardly fuck I was. At one point early on I offered to walk to the shops and buy some more, but that just made things worse because it wasn't the money she cared about, it was the lie. I was so scared I hid and cried under a rusted out car in the backyard. The only reason I didn’t just leave and walk home was because I was scared to come out from under the car and I couldn’t stand the idea going back home to get screamed at by an angry drunk either. I don’t even remember how or when I got back home that day, but I never came back.

The worst part of all this is that the only reason she ever apologised was because she later found out It was her boyfriend who'd drunk the milk, not me. She would have been proud of herself to this day if I had. 

After that, I had nowhere else to go any more, I just had to deal with my foster mother by myself up until the day she died 6 years later. I dealt with her very poorly during those years and I wish she’d died sooner.

I only saw my brothers and sisters a few days a year on birthdays, and only for an hour or so. The years in my life I should have spent really getting to know who they were and turning into people together, instead I spent forgetting them and being forgotten by them. I don’t even remember my sisters at all from back then, my memories of the two of them basically start when I was 19, when government briefly took away the rest of my mother's kids they came to stay at my place for a while. Funnily enough, the call I'd made to the child helpline all those years ago played a minor role in this.

And that's the end of that story. It's less than half of what I'd written in that document, but the rest is another story.

"Funny, besides how stupid, ignorant and naive your comment is, Last time I checked our Founding Fathers were neither politicians or lawyers. 

""Plantation owners and farmers, doctors, lawyers, and businessmen-all included in the variety of Founding Father occupations. Below are a sampling of the occupations from our best known Founding Fathers. At the time of the Constitutional Convention, six individuals were major land speculators, including Robert Morris and Wilson. In addition to these land speculators, twelve Founding Fathers such as Mason and Washington owned or managed slave-operated plantations or large farms. Madison also owned slaves. Franklin, Robert Morris, and Sherman had jobs working with securities. 


Thirteen people were businessmen, merchants, or shippers, including Robert Morris, Sherman, and Wilson. Two of the less known Fathers, Broom and Few, were small farmers. Supplementing his other employment, Franklin was known as a scientist. Although not as well know, McClurg, McHenry, and Williamson were physicians, and Johnson was a university president. 


Madison studied theology and thirty-five Founding Fathers had legal training as lawyers. 


Most of the Founding Fathers were employed in more than one type of occupation.""

"How does hunting have anything to do with debt? That analogy has NOTHING to do with debt. But more about Nash Equilibrium, which has nothing to do with debt. Debt is a zero sum game. For example, if I lend you a dollar, and prices go down, has the system suffered? I can purchase more, but you owe me more.

PLEASE read up on Nash equilibriums. Self interest parties with maximum communication among players will pick the decision that benefits the system in whole because in the long run.

For example, back to your hunting example, if in the long run, people were really self interested and could communicate with others. Then they would all hunt in a reduced manner because they would want the most deer in the long run. The internet (AKA perfect communication) allows people to switch their strategy from the strong Nash Equilibrium to the perfect strategy but still in self interest.

To answer your questions:

1) What do you think my next move should be?

Definitely purchase Naxx if you're planning on spending any real money on the game. It's way cheaper than using in-game gold to do so, and the single player campaign is pretty fun.

Otherwise, if you're completely free-to-play, I might wait until the expansion is released to see how the meta shakes out. Mech Zoo looks to be really strong, and it might not require that many cards from Naxx -- we'll see.

2) Does arena present me with the full card list as options or only within cards I own?

"Sorry, your submission was removed from /r/listentothis because your account doesn't yet meet our minimum requirements for submitting music. We have to take these measures to combat spammers - it's nothing personal. We'd like you to get to know the place better before contributing, so for now, just listen and enjoy the music. Please read this entire reply - we're trying to help you become successful on reddit.

**First time redditors** should be aware of [reddit's site-wide guidelines.](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette) If you are planning to submit your own music in listentothis, you must read the guidelines for [self-promotion on reddit.](http://reddit.com/wiki/selfpromotion) Violating these site-wide rules will result in a site-wide shadowban - that's just the way reddit operates, there's nothing we can do about it.

**New users** should take the time to read the [listentothis introduction](/r/listentothis/wiki/reddiquette) to learn what this place is all about, and how we operate. Keep in mind, if you haven't got anything positive to say in your comment, it's best not to say anything. Earning downvotes will block your comments, so comment wisely.

New users must maintain a minimum level of positive community contributions to submit music links in listentothis. Again, this is nothing personal, it's something we *have to do* to avoid spammers clogging up our feed to the tune of 50-100 submissions each day. We can't tell you what this score is. We can only tell you that anyone who actively uses reddit and is a *positive* part of the community will have no problem earning their way past this limit quickly.

**If you wish to promote music in listentothis without participating in the community,** you can buy cheap ($5-$30) [sponsored links.](http://www.reddit.com/advertising) These will place your music at the *top of the page* for a couple of days without the need to earn upvotes. Everyone will see them. These advertisements are *extremely effective.*

If you have any questions about reddit, please [read the reddit faq.](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/faq)

**If you are just starting out on your career as a musician,** listentothis is not the place where you want to submit your first musical creations. This is the place for *finished* tracks and albums that are for sale. There are however many other active, knowledgeable music communities made up of people like you, who will give you feedback and advice, even technical tips, on how to improve your sound. Reddit will even help you to find new band members and learn to play an instrument. Some of the most well known communities are listed below.

* /r/thisisourmusic - share your songs for feedback
* /r/theseareouralbums - share your albums for feedback
* /r/icoveredasong - share your covers for feedback
* /r/mashups - share your new mashup creations
* /r/remix - share your remixes
* /r/ratemyaudio - get critical feedback on your music *production*
* /r/wearethemusicmakers - reply to the feedback threads in their sidebar
* /r/radioreddit - a radio station of redditor-made music hungry for your tracks

The **[music makers multireddit](/u/evilnight/m/musicmakers)** contains 80 communities, each dedicated to a different aspect of making music. There is no better place on the entire internet to get advice and feedback on your own music. Use these resources, they *will* help you become a better musician.

As you participate in these communities, you will quickly earn enough karma to submit your music in listentothis, and prove that you are not a spammer. We apologize for all of these hoops, however there is no other way to protect this subreddit from spammers. Thank you for understanding, and good luck in your music career!

Not sure how they arrived at this, but it seems like their official definition. This store is newly opened in my area so I am assuming they have recently went through training.

"&gt; Less real life locations more CGI background

Which is pretty common nowadays... The original trilogy also relied on CGI for a lot of shots.  

&gt; Characters that were meant to be done with makeup/costume are now CGI, characters that were meant to have a natural face are now full of make up.

I agree that a lot of CGI characters could have been done with makeup (Azog being a prime example) but I don't feel like it made the movie less enjoyable.

&gt; Characters that weren't meant to be there

Again, Tauriel and Azog come to mind (Azog was supposed to have been dead for 200+ years IRC). I think Tauriel was a fun character but the romance with Kili felt sort of superfluous. especially considering it barely impacted the story at all.

&gt; Dead horse beatings on the story links between the two trilogies

"It's sort of both - I rarely have *no* signal in the 'hills. I usually just have no data. That persists for a few stretches of 20-40 minutes, and then I'm close enough to civilization again to get my data. The spots where I have *no* signal represent just a few miles. 

You're right, there's a chance I *could* break down with no phone capabilities, but it's the same on all carriers. My GF has AT&amp;T, and I had it for about 7 years, and there are places where I get signal (inside Dallas) that she doesn't. It's not very common, but it's a risk for every carrier.

The issue becomes a cost/benefits analysis - is the benefit of superior signal in more places worth the much greater cost, and the additional cost of much greater restrictions on data and texts and other features (free tethering on my plan, for instance)? 

I posit that for me, and many others, the answer is that the cost is not justified when you weigh the options. For you, if you travel through rural areas a lot, I could see how it would be justifiable for the peace of mind.
